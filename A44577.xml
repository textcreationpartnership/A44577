            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Christian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>BE pleased to understand a few things concerning these ensuing Sermons. <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Author hath had no less Encouragement to the Publication of them, than in such Cases is usual, <hi>i. e.</hi> the good Approbation (that he may not say also the Solicitation) of some of his worthy Brethren and Betters, to whose censure they were committed, and in whose hands (in order to their perusal) for some time they rested.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That having been in the Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grancy of the late Warre, about thirty
<pb facs="tcp:48664:3"/> four Months agoe, fitted and designed for publick Use, they have ever since lyen like the Cripple at the Pool of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> ready indeed for the Press, and there waiting; but (till very lately) still wanting one to put them in; the Obscurity of any Author (if a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey Minister <hi>Ã¨ Vulgo Cleri</hi>) being no small discouragement to such an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, forasmuch as it is the Interest of every Stationer antecedently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto to consider, that it is the Name, and Fame and Popularity of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which doth mainly contribute to the certain and quick sale of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons: it being the manner of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Readers not so much to regard <hi>what</hi> is written, as by <hi>whom:</hi> Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant whereunto seems that Aphorism of the wise Observer, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9.16. <hi>The Poor mans Wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Old Saying is here consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, <hi>Sat citÃ², si sat benÃ¨;</hi> although the Sermons so long since composed,
<pb facs="tcp:48664:3"/> have not till this time a-day been brought to light; nevertheless all's well, if (being at last come abroad, by the Blessing of God) they prove to be profitable, so as to verifie the common Proverb, <hi>Better late than never.</hi> The onely thing obvious to be objected, is, The <hi>Æ²nseasonableness</hi> of the present Publication, in a time of Peace, of what was composed three years agoe, amidst the Noyse of Warre. But for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting or removing of any such preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, which may occasion the utter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting or slighting thereof, as now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together needless and useless, (like an Almanack of the other Year, quite out of date) I shall humbly suggest a few things to consideration; and for that Purpose be it considered:</p>
            <p n="1">(1) Though <hi>Tempora mutantur,</hi> yet there is small, or no Appearance, that, <hi>Nos mutamur:</hi> I mean, although through the good hand of God upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the Nation, there is a blessed Change in our outward Condition,
<pb facs="tcp:48664:4"/> from a destructive Warre to a most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Peace; nevertheless it appears not that there is any Change in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Manners and ungodly Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the generality among us; those who were wicked and unreformed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being as unreformed and wicked still. How doth prophaneness of all sorts, and in all sorts, continue and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound as visibly as before? Can we instance how or wherein we have been or are Reformed by any of Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that of latter years have been upon us? Doe not we still persist to walk as cross and contrary to God, as heretofore? May not God justly take up the same iterated Complaint against us, as against his People of old, saying as in <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6, 8, 9, 10. <hi>Yet, yet, yetâ€” have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord;</hi> And as in <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.4, 5. <hi>Ah sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Nation, a People laden with Iniquityâ€” Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) Consequently consider, <hi>how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb facs="tcp:48664:4"/> to our deserts</hi> God hath given us the Blessing of a <hi>present Peace,</hi> and how seasonable thereupon it is for us to mind and to be minded of that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.31, 32. <hi>Then shall ye remember your own evil wayes and your doings, that were not good, and shall loath your selves in your own sight for all your Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and for all your Abominations. Not for your sakes doe I this, saith the Lord God, be it known unto you, be ashamed and confounded for your own wayes, O House of Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whatever God in Mercy hath done for us, it concerns us to know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that it is not for our own sake that God hath done it; and that we may be as loathsome to God now, as before; and that the minding of our sins with shame, and sorrow, and self-loathing, is a Duty which God doth even now call for and expect from us.</p>

               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:48664:5"/> about us be concluded, no Peace can be made with God upon any terms on this side <hi>Reformation.</hi> 'Tis the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Reformation which under Christ is the onely way to Reconciliation with a provoked God; so that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be our Friends, or at Peace with us, we may be sure, that if we are not Reformed, God is still our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?</p>
            <p n="4">(4) Consider, If we remain still <hi>Æ²n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed,</hi> and God not reconciled, what (according to Reason and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) is to be expected? what, but Gods bereaving us of our present <hi>Peace?</hi> what, but a return of the same Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as we formerly suffered? Yea what but the inflicting of seven times worse than before, according to the tenour of the Text in hand? <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.23, 24. Well may we say to those, who during the reigning Evils of the present times, do flatter themselves with hopes of seeing <hi>good dayes,</hi> as <hi>Jehu</hi> did to the Messengers of <hi>Jehoram,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.22.
<pb facs="tcp:48664:5"/>
               <hi>What</hi> (lasting) <hi>peace so long as the Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Abominations of our Land are so many?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5) Consider, What a farther strong Obligation to Reformation Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Mercy in the <hi>present Peace</hi> and quiet of our Nation hath put upon us. As God seeks by his Judgments to drive and affright Sinners into a Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their cross and contrary walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, so by his Mercies doth he draw and allure them thereunto. These are styled, <hi>The cords of a Man, and bands of Love,</hi> Hos. 11.4. With such Cords and Bands doth God now attempt to draw, and to with-draw us from our sins, and to draw us to himself and Service, even with the Silken Golden Cord, the sweet Blessing of a welcome Peace, after the bitter Experience of a bloody Warre, and such a Warre of which it may be said in allusion to those words of the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 19.14. <hi>(This is a Lamentation, and shall be for a Lamentation.)</hi> This was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb facs="tcp:48664:6"/> of sore Lamentation among our selves, and this is like to be for a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and for a Lamentation (God knows how long) among all our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Countreys and Kingdoms. O what Thankfulness doth our present Peace (comparatively with those our Neighbours who do sigh and groan and bleed under the want of it) call for from us? But withall consider,</p>
            <p n="6">(6) What is the Thanksgiving which upon account of our present Peace (with all its concomitant Blessings) God doth require, or wherein it doth consist? Surely it is not in that of our Lips merely, but of our Lives; it is not <hi>verbal</hi> but <hi>real</hi> thanks, that God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects. And to the Question, <hi>What's that?</hi> It may in a word be answered, <hi>It is Reformation;</hi> This is Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, real Thankfulness, the onely real Thankfulness; and this is it that the ensuing Sermons do mainly drive at, and which the Author doth therein in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously set himself to drive on. The
<pb facs="tcp:48664:6"/> Apostle indeed exhorts us to <hi>offer by Christ the Sacrifice of Prayse to God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, giving thanks to his Name; Heb.</hi> 13.15. But to what purpose is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of a wicked, of an unreformed Person or People? Surely the Sacrifice of their Prayse is of no better esteem with God than that of their Prayer, of which <hi>Solomon</hi> testifies, saying, <hi>It is abomination to the Lord, Prov.</hi> 15.8. Without Reformation, Prayer it self is an Abomination to God: That the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Prayer may be accepted, it is absolutely necessary, that the Sacrificer or supplicant himself be personally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p n="7">(7) Consider, That our persisting to walk contrary to God, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his present ceasing to walk contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to us (I mean his gracious dealing with us, in the restoring our Peace) will receive a new <hi>Aggravation,</hi> and expose us to that shamefull, heart-cutting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O ye foolish People and unwise?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:48664:7"/> Upon such a persisting in wayes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to our Benefactor, it may be justly layd to our charge, That we have added Ingratitude to our Sin; and this Addition will beget a new Controversie betwixt God and us, as appears by the dear-bought Experience of Gods ungratefull <hi>Israel</hi> of old, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.2, 3. <hi>The Lord hath a Controversie with his People, and he will plead with Israel;</hi> and what was the ground of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie? It was <hi>Israels</hi> Ingratitude, as appears by the Bill of Indictment brought in against them, and left upon Record in the following Verses, 3, 4, 5. Hereupon it may well become us all, (both in Prudence and Conscience) to say as did that zealous Reformer upon a like Consideration as before specified, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9.13. <hi>After all this is come upon us,</hi> (these and these Judgements) <hi>for our evil deeds, and for our great trespasses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord our God hath punished us less than our Iniquities deserve, and hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us</hi> out of such a Destructive
<pb facs="tcp:48664:7"/> Warre as as this, (given us such a desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, undeserved Peace) <hi>should we again break his Commandements, and joyn in Affinity</hi>â€” should we continue still un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reformed? should we still persist in wayes of contrariety to God? <hi>would not he be angry with us, till he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Premises considered, the instant publication of the ensuing Sermons seems to be no less seasonable and suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the present times and state of things among us, than was the Prophet <hi>Obeds</hi> Sermon to <hi>Asa</hi> and all <hi>Judah,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately upon their deliverance from an eminent Danger, that threatned both King and Kingdom, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. <hi>The Lord is with you</hi> (saith the Prophet) <hi>while ye are with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While we are with God, we may be sure that God is and will be with us, but no longer; for if we forsake him, we shall be forsaken by him: And woe
<pb facs="tcp:48664:8"/> to <hi>Asa,</hi> with all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin;</hi> Wo to King, and woe to Kingdom when God departs from them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 9.12. Reformation then you perceive is as necessary for the preventing of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as for the removal of incumbent Judgments; it is alike necessary to the preserving, as to the restoring of the Peace and Prosperity of a Nation.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this Prefatory Epistle in allusion to those words upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord by the Prophet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 40.6. <hi>The Voyce said, Crye; And he said, What shall I crye?</hi> God, it seems, had by a secret Voyce given something in charge to the Prophet, by him alone to be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Ears of the people, <hi>[A Voyce said, Crye,]</hi> whereupon the Prophet listening to his Charge, sayes, <hi>[What shall I crye?]</hi> In allusion hereunto, the Author craves leave to say, That to his seeming he hears somewhat the like from God, given in charge by him and other the Heralds and Ministers of God, to be proclaimed throughout all
<pb facs="tcp:48664:8"/> corners and quarters of the Land; The Voyce of God by his Judgements, (his former Judgments) says to us, <hi>Cry:</hi> And the Voyce of God by his Mercies, (his present Mercies) sayes to us, <hi>Cry.</hi> Now what is it that we are bid thus to crye? What is it in effect more than this one word <hi>Reformation, Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> And that it may be done with more Efficacy, what more needfull to be cryed than these two or three words, wherewith the following Sermons in the Frontispiece thereof are intituled, <hi>Reformation or Ruine, Reformation or Ruine?</hi> Reformation is the thing which the Judgements of God as with a loud Voyce do call and cry for; It is that which the Mercies of God do aloud call for; It is that which the Text in hand, <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.23, 24. doth call for; It is that which God himself by all these doth with A Vengeance call for, <hi>i. e.</hi> with A Vengeance threatned; yea, with a Vengeance upon Vengeance threatned, if the Cry be not heard,
<pb facs="tcp:48664:9"/> and his Call answered: What remains then, but that by these <hi>Cryes</hi> of God, these Out-cryes of his, we be all of us so <hi>timely</hi> awakened, as that we may not <hi>finally</hi> be ruined. This verily is both <hi>Finis operis &amp; operantis, i. e.</hi> It is the native tendency of the ensuing Sermons, and it is also the hearts De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and Prayer of the (however weak and unworthy, yet) truely willing and well-meaning Author,</p>

               <p>The two verses put together, are for the form
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48664:28"/> of them a Commination, or as to their formal nature they are an expresse and severe Threatn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and upon that account you may perhaps say of or to me, as the Prophet did to <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> Wife, I am come to you with heavy ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48664:29"/> concerning a Kingdome, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it.</hi>â€” God useth to speak destruction <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to threaten it to Nations and Kingdomes, before he doth down with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and destroy them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.4. <hi>I have hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them by my Prophets, and slain them,</hi> (how?) <hi>by the words of my mouth</hi> (i. e.) <hi>by my threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of slaughter to, or against them.</hi> Before God doth stay sinners, <hi>ore Gladij,</hi> with the mouth of the sword, he useth to slay them <hi>gladio Oris,</hi> with the sword of his mouth <hi>(i. e.)</hi> with the words or threatnings of his mouth, which should be looked upon (to speak in the words of the Psalmist in another case) as drawn swords.

                  <head>Reasons.</head>
                  <p>First, One Reason may be taken from the Love and mercy and compassion of God towards sinners, his Willingness to spare them, and his Lothness (as of himself) to punish and destroy them. This is it that the Scriptures do abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly testifie of God, and that God doth testifie of himself, <hi>Am.</hi> 3.33. <hi>He doth not willingly grieve, nor afflict the Children of men:</hi> 2 Pet. 3.9. <hi>God
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48664:30"/> is long-suffering to usward, not willing that Any should perish, but that All should come to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Most passionately affecting are those words of God brought in by the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> speaking of himself, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.8. <hi>How shall I give thee up</hi> Ephraim? <hi>how shall I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And to the same purpose doth God testifie of himself, under his Oath, not only Saying but also Swearing, <hi>As I live, I have no ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>sure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, &amp; live.</hi> Ez. 33 11. Now this mercy &amp; pity of God, is in all respects, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all accounts, the reason of the point in hand; for</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is the rise, and fountain, or inward mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cause thereof; and in this nature it is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and alleadged by the Chronologer, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 36.15. <hi>And the Lord God of their fathers sent to them by his Prophets rising betimes, and sending them,</hi> Why? <hi>Because he had compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on his people, and on his dwelling place.</hi> The Particle [Because] in that place hath not

But the cause of a thing consequent, is more than the reason of a Logical consequence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The demonstration of the said love and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of God, is the final cause thereof. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the said <gap reason="foreign">

The Fisher and Fowler, by stealing upon the Fish and Fowl, do declare that their direct will and intent was, to make a prey of them; But God by a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dealing with sinners, declares a contrary end, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was not willing that sinners should become a prey to his Justice, but that they should (as Lot out of <hi>Sodom</hi>) take wing, make haste and escape for their lives. It is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out manifest cause, that the Prophet stiles Gods punishing, or his punishments upon sinners, his strange Acts, and strange Works, <hi>Isa.</hi> 28.21. they being such Acts an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, A secondary reason is, the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of his Justice, in c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Teaching, every Man, says he, and warning every Man. Let us warn Young and Old, Poor and Rich; the best man in the Parish, as well as the poorest Labourer; the Lord of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, as well as his poor Tenants, and rack-renters. As God said to his Prophets of old, Be not afraid of the Faces, or dismayed at the looks of the proudest Dame, the stoutest Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant.

Let us imagine God himself, who hath counted us Faithful, putting us into the Ministry, saying to us, as to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Ezek. 3.17. <hi>Son of Man, I have made thee a Watch-man to the House of</hi> Israel; <hi>therefore hear the word at my mouth,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48664:34"/> and give them warning from me.</hi> Whether we please, or displease Men; whether People will hear, or whether they will forbear; let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Gods Name to do the Office of Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men <hi>(i. e.)</hi> From time to time, and according to all emergencies to give warning.</p>

O resolve, saying with the said <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 16.7. <hi>I will bless the Lord, who hath given me Counsel;</hi> I will bless the Lord, who hath given me warning. This is more than God is necessitated, or obliged to do. It is purely of his courtesie to do it: For God can as easily smite, as speak; punish us, as speak a word of warning to us. Well may we acknowledge, and acknowledge with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness the undeserved favour of God in this thing, saying, with the <hi>Psalmist, The Lord hath not dealt with us after our sins, nor Rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us according to our Iniquities,</hi> Psal. 103.10.</p>

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:48664:35"/> says, that being under Affliction, he was dumb and opened not his Mouth, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> In the way of murmuring and complaint, even upon this Consideration, because the Lord did it; much more should the Consideration of these two things stop our Mouths, and silence us as to complaining and murmuring, considering to wit, 1. Who doth it. 2. How he doth it; for as we may say unto God, with the <hi>Psalmist, Thou, Lord, didst it;</hi> so we may say farther, Thou, Lord, didst it not without warning; yea, warning upon warning. And upon this Account let us not altogether, or in all Respects be dumb and silent, but let us open our mouths in a free acknowledgment of the Justice and Equity of God in his severe proceed ngs against us, saying, with the Church, as in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.33. <hi>Thou art just in all that is brought upon us, for thou hast done right, but we have done wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly.</hi> And as in <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The Lord is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, for I have Rebelled against his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Let every sinner say for himself and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this case, as the good Thief upon the Cross, I am, we are in this Condemnation justly, for we suffer but the due reward of our deeds. Well may we make this acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for what more just, than that he, or they should suffer and smart to purpose, who being warned, and warned again, would take no warning; who being warned, would not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48664:36"/> be warned. In this case it becomes sinners to say, not onely as did <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magicians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Plagues of <hi>Egypt, (Exod.</hi> 8.19. <hi>Hic est digitus Dei, This is the Finger of God,</hi>) but to say also, as did <hi>Jehu</hi> of that exemplary Judgment, which befel <hi>Jezebel,</hi> (2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.32.) <hi>Hoc est verbum Dei, This is the word of the Lord, which he spake</hi> â€” Thus, or to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose let sinners under their sufferings acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, saying, This is the word of the Lord, which he hath oft spoken in my hearing; I have been oft, and often told, and warned of this heavy Hand of God, and of these, and these sins, which have now found me out. A little Grace will serve turn to produce such an acknowledgment. If we had Grace so much as a grain of Mustard-seed (to speak in the Language of our Saviour) it were enough to make us confess as much as that comes to; even the workings of a Natural Conscience have thus far prevailed with some sinners: As <hi>Reuben</hi> said to his Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.22. <hi>Spake I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the Child, and you would not hear; therefore behold also his Blood is required.</hi> In this sort are sinners under sore punishments, rated by their own Consciences, saying, Did not the Lord warn thee, and speak to thee, saying, Leave thy wicked Courses, thy Drinking, Drabbing, Gaming, Cursing, Swearing â€” but thou would'st
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48664:36"/> not hear? Therefore the vengeance threatned is now inflicted. God hath extorted such a Confession as this even from wicked Men, when they have been brought to, or laid upon the Rack, as we see in the Experiment of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who confessed, saying, <hi>The Lord is Righteous, and I and my People are wicked,</hi> Exod. 8.19.</p>

As God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self says to <hi>Cain,</hi> Gen. 4.7. But sinners are wofully herein mistaken. <hi>Am I become your Enemy,</hi> says St. <hi>Paul, because I tell you the truth?</hi> Gal. 4.16. <hi>q. d.</hi> I am not, I am not your Enemy upon that Account, and you may be ashamed to think as you do. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> said to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in a like case of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice they had against him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. So may God's Ministers say, <hi>Wherefore? because We love you not? God knoweth.</hi> Wherefore do
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48664:38"/> we tell sinners of their sin and danger? Is it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we love them not? God knows, and knows the contrary, and it concerns sinners to know it also.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Consider, That this is profitable work. True, it is none of the most pleasing work in it self barely considered, there being something in it, that is of an unpleasing Nature, and for that Cause it is a work, that doth please neither Ministers, nor People. Ministers, if they were left to their choyce, would much rather be doing other work, they would rather be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing and comforting their People, and they may appeal to God, saying, with the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, Chap.</hi> 17.16. <hi>We have not desired the woful day, thou knowest.</hi> And as for People, we must acknowledge, that as St. <hi>Paul</hi> said, in the like work, to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20. So may we say of our selves, in this our work of Admonition, That People do find us therein such as they would not; so that in some respects this work is mutually displeasing, both to us and you. But for all that, the work may be profitable: For what doth not please, may profit notwithstanding. Yea, it may be truly said, that however this their work proves to be in the issue thereof, it is nevertheless as to the tendency of it most profitable. That of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> (Prov. 14.23. <hi>In all Labour there is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, (i. e.)</hi> Virtually, and in the tendency

                  <p>LET three things be Considered, 1. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of God's warnings. There are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48664:41"/> two things, which sinners have no certainty of. 1. They are not certain how long they shall be in a Condition of being warned, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> How long they shall Liveâˆµ For who knows, what a few days, yea, what one day may bring forth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.1. Yet a little while and sinners will be past warning. <hi>To him that is joyned to the Living there is hope,</hi> Eccl. 9.4. But when we are under ground, when once we are Lodged in our cold Earth, we are in no hope, in no Capacity of being warned; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Grave, whither we are all going, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.10. Go to now, ye sinners, that say, you mean to mend at such and such a time, you intend to turn over a new leaf when you have sown your wild Oats, when you have got a Wife, and settled in the World, when your Youthful time is a little over â€” <hi>Whereas ye know not what shall be on the Morrow: For what is your Life? Is it not a Vapour, that appeareth for a very little while, and then vanisheth away?</hi> James 4.13, 14. <hi>Man knoweth not his time</hi> (the most knowing man knows not his time) <hi>as the Fishes are taken in an evil Net, and as the Birds are caught in the Snare, so are the Sons of Men Snared in an evil time, when it comes sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly upon them,</hi> Eccl. 9.12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sinners are not certain, though they Live, how long God will continue to warn them at
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48664:41"/> the rate they have been warned. Even in this Respect also man knoweth not his time, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion to those words of the <hi>Psalmist, (Psal.</hi> 74.9. <hi>There is no more any Prophet, neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.</hi>) I may say, There is no sinner that knoweth, or can Prophecy, how long <hi>(i. e.)</hi> how long God will continue to warn him; for God's Spirit will not alway strive with sinners, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. There is a two-fold striving of God with man, <hi>viz.</hi> In Mercy and in Judgment; in this latter Respect, God's not striving with man is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed as a favour, <hi>Esay</hi> 57.16. But in the former Respect, it is threatned as a Judgment, <hi>viz.</hi> God's not striving with sinners by Counsels, Reproofs, Admonitions, warnings, whether by his Ministers, the Preachers of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (such as <hi>Noah</hi> was in his Generation) or by the inward motions, or excitations of his Spirit in the Hearts and Consciences of sinners. As there is a time for all things, and a season for every purpose under Heaven, so there is a season for God's gracious treating with sinners, and there is a time when he will leave off to treat with them; and what sinner having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent warning, can say to the contrary, but that this may be the last?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Consider the mischief, or mischievous Consequence of not Heeding God's warnings, of not taking the warnings which God gives:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48664:42"/> I mean, the woful consequences thereof, both in respect of sin and punishment, <hi>e. g.</hi> 1. In respect of sin, it doth much aggravate the sin of sinners. Their sin doth by this Occasion become (to speak in the words of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.13. <gap reason="foreign">

The sins of God's People of Old, both of <hi>Israel,</hi> and of <hi>Judah,</hi> are charged upon them, as aggravated by this sad Circumstance. See 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.12, 13. <hi>They Served Idols, whereof the Lord had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing. Yet the Lord testified against</hi> Israel, <hi>and against</hi> Judah, <hi>by all the Prophets, and by all the Seers, saying, turn ye from your evil ways, and keep ye my Commandments and my Statutes, according to all the Law, which I Commanded your Fathers, and which I sent to you by my Servants the Prophets.

               <p n="2">2. COnsider the mischievous Consequence of this sin in Respect of punishment, which mischief is three-fold; for it doth both necessitate, and Precipitate, and aggravate God's Judgments upon sinners. 1. It doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate Judgment, making it unavoydable; whereas before it was Conditional: Now (the Condition of escaping it being not performed) it becomes absolute, according to the Rule which Civilians give us for the Interpretation of Conditional Promises and Threatnings, they saying, That when the Condition thereof is performed, or not performed, then the said promise and threatning do become Absolute. And as our Lawyers say, There is abundance of Reason in our Law, so I may truly say, There is enough of Reason ever obvious in that said determination in the Civil Law. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16, 17. <hi>But they mocked the Messengers of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48664:43"/> the Lord, and despised his words, and mis-used his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, till there was no Remedy.</hi> Be sinners never so sinful, yet while they have not stood out against warnings, it may be rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly said, there is a Remedy for the preventing the Execution of Divine wrath, <hi>viz.</hi> By God's giving, and by sinners their taking warning; but when no warning given will be taken, this makes a sinners Case to be remediless. Then we may say, <hi>Conclamatum est;</hi> then may we say of a Church and Kingdom, as he in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy said of a Prodigal, wasting Family, <hi>Ipsa si cupiat salus servare han<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> familiam, prorsus non potest;</hi> Mercy it self cannot save sinners in this Case.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It doth precipitate, or hasten Judgment, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1. <hi>He that being often Reproved hardneth his Neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without Remedy.</hi> That one Scripture proves the Truth of both the said things here Asserted, <hi>viz.</hi> That a sinners not taking warning, doth both necessitate and precipitate his ruine. This sin of not taking warning is like the last stroke, or blow of the Ax, which cuts down the Tree; though many, and many blows are stricken before the Tree falls, yet there is one blow, <hi>viz.</hi> the last, which doth immediatly cut it down: Even so, although many and many sins do meritoriously co-operate to God's
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48664:43"/> bringing down Judgments upon sinners, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless it is sinners their not taking warning, which doth immediately, and proximately ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. Hence it is, that presently upon the Relation of sinners their guilt in this kind; the very next thing we read, or hear of them, is, the powring forth of God's Judgments upon them. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16, 17. <hi>But they mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Messengers of the Lord, and despised his words, and mis-used his Prophets, untill the wrath of the Lord arose against his people, till there was no Remedy: Therefore he brought upon them the King of the</hi> Chaldees, <hi>who slew their Young Men with the Sword</hi> â€” And <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.26, 27. <hi>Nevertheless they were disobedient, and Rebelled against thee, and cast thy Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs, and slew thy Prophets, which testified against them, to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.</hi> Now Observe what doth instantly follow upon this their sin, <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>Therefore thou delivered'st them into the Hand of their Enemies, who vexed them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It doth Aggravate Judgment. No less upon grounds of Justice can be expected than that that, which doth aggravate the Sin of sinners, should aggravate their Punishment. <hi>For,</hi> Job. 34.11. <hi>the work of a man will God render unto him,</hi> says <hi>Elihu, &amp; cause every Man to find according to his ways, (i. e.)</hi> not onely according to their ways respectively to their kind (good or evil)
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48664:44"/> but Respectively to their degree also (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very good, or very evil.) See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.5. <hi>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, yet shall know, that there hath been a Prophet among them, (i. e.)</hi> A Prophet, who did the Duty of a Faithful Prophet among them, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Did hear the Word from the Mouth of God, &amp; did warn them from him. <hi>q. d.</hi> They that know, that they had warning; know it <hi>(i. e.)</hi> with a witness; know it to their cost, know it with a vengeance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what will be the peculiar misery of such sinners, who will take no warning?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.4, 5, <hi>Then whosoever Heareth the sound of the Trumpet, and taketh not warning, if the Sword come and take him away, His Blood shall be upon his own Head. He heard the sound of the Trumpet, and took no warning, his blood shall be upon him.</hi> Observe how the matter is repeated, He heard, he heard the sound of the Trumpet. He took, he took no warning. His Blood, his Blood shall be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, upon his own Head. This is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the misery of him who was not warned, and him that took not warning; both of them dye in their Iniquity, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Blood of the former shall be required at the Hand of him who should have given, but did not give warning: The Blood of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall be upon his own Head, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> none
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48664:44"/> shall Answer for his Ruine but himself, he shall have none to blame, none to lay the blame of his Ruine upon, but himself. To such a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner more especially it may be said, yea, such a sinner more especially may say to himself, as in <hi>Hos.</hi> 13.9. O sinner, thou hast undone thy self, Thou hast destroyed thy self: Thou, and thou alone; Thou, and none but Thou hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed thy self. This sin, in not taking warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, doth silence sinners under God's hand of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and stop their mouths from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining upon any but themselves, which to do is some kind of ease to a Sufferer. I mean, Men under sufferings do in some sort ease them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by uttering their just complaints against others, who have been partial causes at least of their Calamity. But the sinner, who would take no warning, hath no place for such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints. Of any sinners such sinners will prove their own Tormentors.</p>

               <p n="3">3. FOR a third and last Motive, consider the benefit of taking warning when gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for which, see <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.5. <hi>But he, that taketh warning, shall deliver his Soul.</hi> What
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48664:45"/> more can in few words be said, whereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the benefit of giving warning on the Watch-man's part, than this, <hi>viz.</hi> He hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his Soul, as in <hi>v.</hi> 9. And the benefit of taking warning on the Peoples part, than this, <hi>viz.</hi> They shall deliver their own Souls? This implyes, that our Souls do lye at stake in this matter; the losing, or saving of the Souls of sinners doth depend upon their taking, or not taking warning; as sinners would deliver their Souls, so it concerns them to take the warnings which God gives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> What is meant by [Soul] in that place?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The Soul is taken in a two-fold sence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes for Life, and thus frequently, both in the Old and New Testament, <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.8. <hi>Thou hast delivered my Soul, (i. e.)</hi> my Life, <hi>from death.</hi> Thus the word is both used and Interpreted, <hi>Psal.</hi> 26.9. <hi>Gather not my Soul with sinners, nor my Life with bloody men.</hi> 1 Thes. 2.8. <hi>So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the Gospel of God onely, but also our own Souls, (i. e.)</hi> our Lives, as is his Expression, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. <hi>But none of these things move me, neither count I my Life dear to my self, so that</hi>â€”</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is taken for that more Excellent part of Man, which together with the Body doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48664:45"/> the <hi>Compositum,</hi> or make up the whole Man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.26. <hi>What is a Man profited, if he gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul? Or what shall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</hi> Now, the word in the said Text may well be taken in both the said sences. <hi>q. d.</hi> He shall save his Life in this World, he shall escape that temporal Ruine, which shall light upon those who would take no warning, and he shall save his Soul from everlasting Destruction in the World to come.</p>
               <p>Briefly, by Soul, in the Language of this Prophet, as also oft-times in other Scriptures is meant Man himself, Body and Soul. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.14. with <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Though these three Men,</hi> Noah, Daniel, <hi>and</hi> Job <hi>were in it, they should deliver but their own Souls, by their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, saith the Lord God.</hi> Their own Souls, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> themselves, as appears by the Expression, <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>They onely shall be delivered.</hi> This then is the benefit of sinners their taking warning, <hi>viz.</hi> The saving of themselves, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul, both in this World, and in the World to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how can the sinner himself be said to save alive, or deliver his own Soul? As the <hi>Pharisees</hi> said to our Saviour, who can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give sins, but God onely? In like sort, some are ready to Object against the Prophet, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who can save Souls, but God onely?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall take Occasion from hence, to Commend to Observation that 22th.

In which sence, or upon which account, a Christian, by Brotherly Advice and Reproof, is said to save a Soul from Death, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. <hi>lat.</hi> And a faithful Minister, by his good Life and Doctrine, is said to save both himself, and those that hear him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. In a like sence, and upon the like Account is a sinner that takes warning, said, to save, or deliver his own Soul. This then is the great and unspeakable benefit of taking warning when it is given of God, which because it is such a word of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and forasmuch as being willing in such sort to conclude this point, I cannot possibly make a more comfortable Conclusion thereof, I shall close it with the words of the Apostle,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48664:46"/> speaking of another very Comfortable Subject, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.18. <hi>[Wherefore let us Comfort one another with these words.]</hi> Let us Comfort our selves, and Comfort one another with those words; or because the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:48664:50"/> This also is to be understood in all such Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where the Punishments which are threatned by God, or inflicted by him upon a Person or People, are said to be incurable; for that which is incurable, must needs be long and tedious, <hi>Mic.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Her Wound is incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Jer. 30.12. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, thy Bruise is incurable, and thy Wound is grievous.</hi> And v. 15. <hi>Why cryest thou for thine Affliction?

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48664:51"/> kind of Judgment to another, when as sinners do add sin to sin, one kind of sin to another; so God doth add one kind of Judgment to another. As God hath variety of Judgments for various sins, so doth God threaten sinners accordingly with the same. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.23. <hi>I will heap mischiefs upon them, I will spend mine Arrows upon them.</hi> Thus may God be said to punish sinners seven times more <hi>CumulativÃ¨,</hi> when he causes Mischiefs to come upon them thick and three-fold, like <hi>Job</hi>'s Messengers, one upon the heels of another. Under this Head may be comprised, or unto it may be referred that sad and Reproachful Condition of a People, when they lye down under shame as well as sorrow; when God doth punish them with shameful, as well as painful sufferings: As in the Lords hand, says <hi>David,</hi> there is a Cup, and it is full of mixture; so in his hand there is a Quiver, and it is full of Arrows <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of various Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, respectively whereunto sinners may be said to be the But, or Mark at which he shoots, <hi>Psal.</hi> 7.3. and 38.2. <hi>Thine Arrows stick fast in me.</hi> When God doth punish them in such sort, as to expose them to the shame and scorn, Reproach and contempt of their Neighbour-Nations, whether Enemies, or Confederates. This is that kind of Punishment (it being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant usually of other Judgments) which God doth threaten to a sinful Nation. See <hi>Jer.</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:48664:51"/> 29.18. Where God threatens to make them an hissing, and a Reproach among their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to whose Power they should be subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This seems to be implyed in <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.44. Where God threatens his People for their sins, with this Curse among others, That their Enemies should be the Head, and they should be the Tail, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> They should with shame truckle under the power of their Enemies. This also is implyed in those Scriptures, where God threatens to weaken, and bring down the Power of a Nation (that boasted, and trusted to their own strength, and the strength of their Confederates, trusting in an Arm of Flesh) in a most shameful manner, by weak means, and by those, whose Force they did contemn, even in such sort as <hi>Goliath</hi> did defie <hi>David;</hi> or as <hi>Sennacherib</hi> did <hi>Hezekiah, Ezek.</hi> 30.3. This is that kind of punishment, which God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have grievously suffer'd and lamented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.13, 14. <hi>Thou makest us a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to our Neighbours, a Scorn and a Derisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to those that are round about us. Thou makest us a by-word among the Heathen, a shaking of the Head among the People; My Confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my Face hath covered me.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 80 6. <hi>Thou makest us a strife to our Neighbours, and our Enemies Laugh among themselves,</hi> Psal. 79.4. and Jer. 3. <hi>lat. We lye down in our shame, and our
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48664:52"/> Confusion covereth us.</hi> Now, this is a very sore punishment, and as hardly born as almost any, and in regard whereof the Church doth exceedingly lament her low Condition, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>All that pass by clap their Hands at thee, they hiss and wag their Head</hi> â€”</p>
               <p>To this Head also may be referred the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon sinners, as to their good Names, making their Names to rot, and stink above ground, according to that Proverb of <hi>Solomon, Chap.</hi> 10.7. <hi>The memory of the Just shall be blessed, but the Name of the Wicked shall rot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But more especially to this Head may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred God's punishing sinners over and above with spiritual Judgments, depriving them of the means of Grace, his Sabbaths, Word, and Ordinances. This is a sore Judgment indeed, and oft threatned for the sins of a wicked Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11. <hi>Behold, saith the Lord God, the days come, that I will send a Famine in the Land; not a Famine of Bread, nor a thirst for Water, but of hearing the Word of the Lord; and they shall wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North even to the East, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.</hi> So <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. <hi>The Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a Nation bringing forth the Fruits thereof.</hi> When God
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48664:52"/> doth thus add spiritual Judgments to temporal, then he may be truly said to punish sinners seven times for their sins.</p>
               <p n="5">5. When God doth plague sinners,<note place="margin">5. In <hi>ProgeniÃ¨,</hi> or <hi>SuccessivÃ¨</hi> (if I may so express it.)</note> not onely in their Persons, but also in, or as to their Posterity, either by giving them no Issue at all, or else such as are worse than none, perhaps, two-fold more the Children of Hell, than themselves, then may God be said to punish sinners seven times for their sins. And this is that punishment which God doth oft-times in Scripture threaten to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>viz.</hi> To visit the Iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children, to cut off the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them from the Earth, to blot out their Name from under Heaven, that in the next Generation following their Name shall be blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, That the Curse of God shall be upon their Families and Houses â€” <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.33. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 9.6. and 109.13.15. Thus did God threaten the House of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he would not leave them one to piss against the Wall, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.10. and 1.15.29. and 1.21.21. with 2.9.8.

This is threatned at large in <hi>Deut,</hi> 29.21, 22â–ª 23, 24, 25. <hi>And the Lord shall separate thee unto evil out of all the Tribes of</hi> Israel â€” <hi>So that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations to come of your Children, that shall rise up after you, and the stranger, that shall come from a far Land, shall say, when they see the Plagues of that Land, and the sicknesses, which the Lord hath laid upon it â€” Even all Nations shall say, wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this Land? What meaneth the heat of this great Anger? Then Men shall say, Because they have forsaken the Covenant of the Lord God of their Fathers</hi> â€” For God to separate a sinner unto evil, is for God to single him out from those of the same wicked Tribe with himself, from the rest of his Companions, and to punish him for Examples sake, to Gibbet him, to hang him up in Chains, (as I may so say, in allusion to a Custom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among the Nations) to make him a <gap reason="foreign">

Thus God dealt with <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> Plaguing him with Plague upon Plague, and at last, ruining him. Thus he dealt with his <hi>Israel</hi> of Old, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.1.

                  <p>HAving Confirmed the point by Scriptures, I shall endeavour (according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and Method of plain and profitable Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to do it farther by the following Reasons, <hi>e. g.</hi> 1. Because sinning under, or notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing God's Judgments, doth very much Aggravate our sin, it doth put a new tincture, a double dye of guilt upon them; it makes our sins to be crimson and scarlet sins, as is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Esay</hi>'s Expression, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.18. he there speaking of the sins of a Nation Aggravated by this very Circumstance, as appears by <hi>ver.</hi> 5. He there saying, <hi>Why should ye be stricken any more? Ye will Revolt more and more,</hi> Prov. 27.22. <hi>Though thou should'st bray a Fool in a Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48664:56"/> among Wheat with a Pestle, yet will his Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness not depart from him, (i. e.)</hi> Though a sinner (for this is the Fool, in the Language of the Wise Man) be Plagued, and Plagued again, and, as it were, pounded to pieces by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy Hand of God upon him, Yet (there is the Note of Aggravation) will not his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (for this his Folly) depart from him, or he from it. There are two special things, that do much Aggravate the sin of a Person or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>viz.</hi> Mercies more than Ordinary received by them, and Punishments more than Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary inflicted on them, but all in vain: For the former, see <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. <hi>Let Favour be shewed to the wicked, Yet will he not Learn Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Hos. 7.13. <hi>Though I have Redeemed them, Yet they have spoken lyes against me.</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, or with this Circumstance as highly Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated, doth God himself, by the Ministry of <hi>Nathan,</hi> set <hi>David</hi>'s sins before his Face, and Charge them home upon his Conscience, and which by the blessing of God proved ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to his Repentance and Pardon, saying, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7, 8. <hi>I Anoynted thee King over Israel, and I delivered thee out of the Hand of</hi> Saul, <hi>and I gave thee thy Masters House â€” Wherefore hast thou despised the Commandment of the Lord?</hi> O that great Persons, High and Mighty Men, would consider what an High and Mighty Aggravation of their sin their
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48664:56"/> great Mercies and High Promotions will be! And as for the other Aggravation of sin by Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in vain inflicted, see <hi>Amos</hi> 4.7. to <hi>v.</hi> 12. Where God having enumerated various pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments, whereby they had suffered (Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, Fire, Plague â€”) still bring in this upon the foot of the Account, <hi>Yet, Yet, Yet</hi> â€” (This <hi>Yet</hi> is five times repeated) have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord? See how King <hi>Ahaz</hi> is marked with a black Coal, I mean branded as an Infamous sinner, upon this score, <hi>viz.</hi> because he was not bettered by Affliction, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22. <hi>This is that King</hi> Ahaz, <hi>q. d.</hi> Such a Monster of Wickedness was this King <hi>Ahaz.</hi> See the like brand of Ignominy upon the self-same Account put upon a wicked Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.28. <hi>This is a Nation that Obeyeth not the voyce of the Lord their God, nor Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth Correction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> How doth this appear so much to Aggravate the sin of a wicked Person or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</p>
                  <p>I Answer (and the Answers may serve as to many distinct Reasons of the point in hand) 1. Because sinning notwithstanding Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it, doth argue a Person to be a wilful sinner, or to sin wilfully. This is intimated in the Text, it being rendred, not, <hi>if ye Are not,</hi> but <hi>if ye Will not be Reformed by these things, but will walk contrary unto me.</hi> Two things do
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48664:57"/> Argue great wilfulness in sinning, 1. Sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Warning and Admonition. 2 Against Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. See both of them put together in that sore-cited Scripture, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.28. It may be said of such sinners, that they are wicked, and they will be wicked; they are wicked, because they will be wicked. Now, by how much there is more of the Will in sinning, by so much the greater is the sin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Because this kind of sinning doth Argue a sinner to be an Obstinate and stubborn sinner. Obstinacy and stubborness is upon the Matter, or for the kind (I conceive) all one with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness; onely I think it to be a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of wilfulness, or wilfulness in the highest degree: And for that Cause I nominate it here as somewhat a distinct thing, or as a <hi>Modus rei,</hi> distinct from the former. See what doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate a Child an Obstinate Child, by that in <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.18. <hi>If a Man have a stubborn and Rebellious Son, which will not Obey the Voyce of his Father, or the Voyce of his Mother, and that when they have Chastened him</hi> (mark those words) <hi>will not hearken unto them.</hi> Our Laws do Judge him, who having been in the Goal, House of Correction, or at the Whipping-Post, doth yet continue his idle and wicked Course of Life, to be a stubborn Rogue. A sinners wicked Course of Life is upon this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count denominated his stubborn way, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48664:57"/> 19. where having related the Peoples former Sufferings for their sins, and God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap> Merciful Deliverances, it is added, They ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn way. Seest thou a Person un-reformed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he hath been thus and thus pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for his sin? In allusion to that Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.30. <hi>(Write ye this Man Childless)</hi> I shall say, Note that Person, write him down, A wilful sinner, a stubborn, obstinate, and Rebellious sinner. And see what <hi>Samuel</hi> says of such evils, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23. <hi>Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft, and stubborness is as Iniquity and Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Because the said sinning doth Argue great obdurateness, or hardness of Heart; an Heart exceeding unapt to relent. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3. <hi>O Lord,</hi> says the Prophet, <hi>thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion: They have made their Faces harder than a Rock, they have refused to return.</hi> How often is it said of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who was not reclaimed by Gods Plagues upon him. [<hi>And Pharaoh's Heart was hardned?</hi> Exod. 7.14.22. &amp; 8.19.32. and 9.7, 35 â€” To such a sinner it may be said, Thou art an hard-hearted <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Because this kind of sinning is, in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial sence, or upon a peculiar account, a walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cross, or contrary unto God. It's true
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48664:58"/> indeed, that all sin may well be said, for seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reasons, to be contrary to God; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, a sinners persisting therein, to be a walking contrary to him, <hi>e. g.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it is contrary to Gods Command, Will, or Law: Sin being defined by St. <hi>John, A Transgression of Gods Law,</hi> 1 John 3.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Against Gods Nature, he being an Holy God, and of purer Eyes than to behold evil, or to look upon Iniquity, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1.13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Against Gods Name, or Glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.23. <hi>Through breaking the Law dishonourest thou God?</hi> As all wick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>d walking may (for the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Reasons) be stiled, a walking contrary to God; So pious walking is stiled, a walking with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24. This kind of walking being in Conformity with Gods Nature and Law, and in a tendency to his Honour.</p>
                  <p>But as for sinning, notwithstanding punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this is upon a peculiar account, or upon special Reason, a walking contrary to God. <hi>Qu.</hi> How, or why? <hi>Answ.</hi> Because it doth directly oppose, or thwart Gods Primary end,<note place="margin">This may be said to cross the Providence of God, or God in his Providence as well as in his Commands.</note> or design in punishing sinners, which is, their Reformation, as you heard before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to your notice, and which did offer it self in the very Front of the Text, and in the first place to Observation.</p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48664:58"/>
                  <p>That this is the direct end, and Primary scope of Gods punishments, even upon wicked men. See by that Complaint of God, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.30. <hi>In vain have I smitten your Children, they received no Correction.</hi> Now, that is said to be in vain, that is frustrated of its Primary and proper end: And had not the Reformation of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners been the direct end of Gods Punishing them, there could not (with Reverence to the Divine Majesty be it spoken) be any place for Rational Complaints; and Reason would have been so far on the sinners side, as to Object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lords Complaints, saying, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.19. <hi>Wherefore doth he yet find fault?</hi> Where (by the way) observe a mistake too common, <hi>viz.</hi> Of those who have thought and taught, that this is the difference betwixt the Sufferings of the godly, (which albeit for their sins, they will have stiled on <hi>Ely,</hi> by the Name of Chastisements, and not Punishments at all) So of the wicked, <hi>viz.</hi> That these do proceed from no such thing as that,<note place="margin">There is something in God Analogical to that, which is truly Love and Pity in man, &amp; which cannot more fitly be expressed, or conceived, than by such words.</note> which in Scripture is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Love, or Pity in God, nor are inflicted by God for the Reforming of the wicked, but meerly for the satisfaction of his Justice, and to take due vengeance upon them. But it is apparent by
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48664:59"/> Scripture, that God hath gracious ends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs in punishing the wicked, <hi>viz.</hi> To amend, and to save them, to save them from sin and Hell. Thence that saying of God concerning himself, <hi>Ezek</hi> 24.13. <hi>I have purged thee, and thou wast n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>t purged.</hi> What? Purged, and not Purged? How can this be? Can both parts of a Contradiction be true? <hi>Answ.</hi> By Purged, in the former part, is meant, God his having used all fit and proper means, as well by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as Counsel, whereby to have purged, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Reformed them. That Eighth Canon of the fore-cited, the most Excellent <hi>Glassius,</hi> in his <hi>Philologia Sacra,</hi> concerning Verbs Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive in the Sacred Language, is most memorable, it being in these words, <hi>Verbum, quod Actionem seu effectum notat, de conatu agendi quand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>que intelligendum, &amp; per [Conor] cum propriÃ¨ infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivo Exponendum est.</hi> A golden Rule indeed, which he Exemplifies, as all his other Canons, by several places of Scripture, both in the Old and New Testament. But to return to the Matter in hand, God hath as to this thing the like end in punishing, as in warning sinners; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as he doth Second his word with his Rod; both his word and his Rod come from God upon one Errand, thus far forth, <hi>viz.</hi> The amendment of sinners. A Voyce is ascribed to his Rod, as well as his word, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it:</hi> So that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48664:59"/> God hath somewhat to say to sinners, not onely by his word, but also by his Rod; both speak to sinners in effect, as <hi>Ehud</hi> did to <hi>Eglon, I have a Message,</hi> O sinner, <hi>to thee from God.</hi> And what is their joynt-message, or what is it that both of them have to say from God (and which the sinner therefore should listen to) but this, <hi>Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee</hi> (to speak in the words of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 5.14.) Or, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> delivers the Message, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.3. <hi>Amend your ways and your doings?</hi> By the premises then it doth abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that sinning, notwithstanding Gods pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments for it, is upon a special Account, or for a peculiar Reason, a walking contrary to God, <hi>Quod erat demonstrandum,</hi> this being the thing undertaken to be proved.</p>

And thus in effect is that his [cannot] interpreted, <hi>viz.</hi> by his slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or making light of the invitation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.5. <hi>But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his Farm, another to his Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise.</hi> Briefly, That the main and immediate Reason, why sinners are not Reformed by such Divine Methods as are used for that end (their [cannot] being in true construction) a [will not] appears in this, <hi>viz.</hi> In that when they sin, they sin freely and voluntarily, so freely, as that they are said to choose their way, they way of their abomination, <hi>Esay</hi> 66.3. <hi>To

See <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3. <hi>Thou hast stricken them, but they have not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; thou hast consumed them, but they refused to receive Correction: They have made their Faces harder than a Rock, they have refused to Return.</hi> Observe the word repeated <hi>(They Refused, They Refused.)</hi>

               <p n="6">6. BE hence Informed, that Motives, or Arguments to Reformation, taken from the consideration of the deserved punishment of sin, whether threatned, or inflicted, are very warrantable, and fit to be used; it being not onely Lawful, but the Duty of sinners to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them to the said end and purpose: and be Informed moreover, that the Reformation of sinners, that is wrought by these things <hi>(i. e.)</hi> By the punishments of God upon them, may
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48664:69"/> notwithstanding, be a true, sound, and sincere Reformation. I grant indeed, that all, who while they were under the sore hand of God, did make Vows, and deep Protestations of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, confessing their sins, and professing sorrow for them, and who in shew were much Reformed, yet in Truth were not. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of his People, that when he slew them, then they sought him, but their heart was not right with him â€” <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.34, 35. and that though in a sort they turned to him, yet it was not with their whole Heart, but feignedly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.16. Thence that complaint of God, by the month of <hi>Hosea,</hi> Chap. 6.4. <hi>O</hi> Ephraim, <hi>what shall I do unto thee? O</hi> Judah, <hi>what shall I do unto thee? For your goodness is as a Morning Cloud, and as the early dew, it goeth away.</hi> But others, through the blessing of God, co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating with his hand, have been otherwise wrought upon, even to a thorough and lasting Reformation. Thus was <hi>David</hi> wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went astray; but now have I kept thy word.</hi> And <hi>Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> of whom the Chronicle says, <hi>That when he was in Affliction, he besought the Lord his God, and humbled himself greatly before the Lord God of his Fathers,</hi> 2 Chron. 33.12. And it is not to be doubted, but there be many thousands in in Heaven, not onely of great Men (such as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Manasses</hi> were) but Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48664:69"/> of all sorts and Conditions, who, like the Prodigal, were brought home to their Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father by weeping-cross. Nor let any one think it an unworthy, a selfish, and a slavish temper, to be perswaded, or disswaded upon the said Account; nor let any one say, that these are carnal Motives, the onely Principles of sound Reformation being Spiritual Principles: the Love of God, the Glory of God, the Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of Christ and Christianity â€” Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have been so vain in their Imagination, as to Dogmatize at this rate; and some have been so Foolish, as to deem such the onely sound and Spiritual Preachers. But that the Folly of such may be made known to all men, whereby they may proceed no farther, be it considered, That God onely wise doth urge sinners to Reformation by Arguments of this nature;<note place="margin">Some do call Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Judgment Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and not Gospel-Preaching; whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, that in the Gospel is Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God; so also the wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all ungodliness, and unrighteousness, whereupon the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel doth become the mighty power of God to the Salvation of sinners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18.</note> and is it a thing unworthy of us, or beneath us; a thing more fit for a Slave, than a Son or Servant of God to suffer himself to be thereby induced? Again, shall we call Divine Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, carnal Motives? As the Lord said to St. <hi>Peter, That which I have cleansed call not thou Common:</hi> So
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48664:70"/> I say, to the deluders and deluded in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Those Motives and Arguments, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God himself hath suggested, we may well say are Divine, call not you Carnal.</p>
               <p>Again, Is the Love of God and the Love of our selves things impossible, inconsistent? what doth God mean by all his promises and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in Scripture, if sinners should not have respect unto themselves, to whom and whose welfare those very promises have a respect? What means those complaints of God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, against sinners for destroying themselves, and his Expostulations with them, <hi>Why will ye dye?</hi> And that Complaint of our Saviour (who is denominated such, because he saves sinners from wrath to come) <hi>Ye will not come unto me, that ye may have Life?</hi> John 5.40. How irrational are the said Complaints, if self-love, and self-seeking in this way, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in the way of Reformation were such a thing as too too many Innovators (I do not mean in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, but in certain Doctrinals and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantials) have made them?</p>
               <p>Again, as to the pretence of Spiritual Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, consider, Is not the Fruit of the Spirit in all goodness? <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.9. And is not the fear of God, even as a consuming fire, one part of goodness? Else why doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> speak and exhort at that rate as he doth, saying, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28, 29. <hi>We receiving a Kingdom that cannot be
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48664:70"/> shaken, let us have Grace:</hi> What Grace? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this Grace of Fear, even this conducing to the acceptance of our Service with God, for our God is a Consuming fire, And is not this fear of the Lord a Fruit of Gods Spirit, as well as Love and Joy in God?</p>
               <p>And as for the Glory of God, doth it not mainly consist in the Salvation of sinners? And how can a sinner more glorifie God, than by seeking to save himself, or by accepting Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through Christ when, and as it is offered? Such is the inseparable connexion betwixt the Glory of God and a sinners Salvation, that, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it's true, that his Glory doth oft-times come in competition with Mans temporal safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet it never doth, nor can come into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with his everlasting Salvation; so much are those to be blamed, who have put poor Souls to try the soundness of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version by this mark, <hi>viz.</hi> the seeking of Gods Glory before their own Salvation, or before the seeking of themselves in the Salvation of their own Souls. Is there not some cause to say to such a Preacher, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did to <hi>Elijah,</hi> but altogether without cause, <hi>Art Thou he that troubleth Israel?</hi> Is not this to add Affliction to the Afflicted? Is not this to make the heart of the Righteous sad, whom God hath not made sad? Are not such Preachers like <hi>Jobs</hi> Friends, <hi>Miserable Comforters?</hi> I will not say
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48664:71"/> of such, that their Doctrine is of a tendency to unman Man, or make him no Man; and much less will I say, it is of a tendency to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>god God, or to make him no God: Yet this I would not doubt to say (and were it not for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging this use over-much, I would endeavour to demonstrate) <hi>viz.</hi> That it is of tendency to make Man another manner of Creature, than by his Creator he was made, and to make God another manner of God, than in his word he hath described himself to be.</p>
               <p>The Premises considered, let the Ministers of Christ take heed of binding heavy burdens, and laying Yoaks upon the Necks of humbled Souls, which they are not able to bear; of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting, and and nourishing causless Jealousies in the minds of such as are truly desirous to fear the Name of God, as if to be provoked to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the consideration of Punishment, were a certain sign of a Mercenary, Carnal, Slavish, and a less Spiritual Temper: For consider, doth the onely wise God use such Arguments, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to curb the Saints from sin, onely upon this Account, because of their Carnality, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> because they are Flesh as well as Spirit; and therefore directing them onely as to that fleshly part which is in them? I trow, no; for did not God use an Argument of this Nature, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to restrain <hi>Adam,</hi> even while he was in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, from the breach of his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48664:71"/> not to Reform him, but to preserve him Innocent, saying, <hi>In the Day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt dye the Death,</hi> Gen. 2.17. Let us, the Ministers of God, then take heed of being Righteous over-much as to the thing here spoken of, lest by dogmatizing therein, as some others have done, we offend against God, and against the Generation of his Children, as is the <hi>Psalmists</hi> expression, <hi>Psal.</hi> 73.15. To over-do is to undo.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let no true Convert, Man, or Woman; let no sinner truly Reformed, call into Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Truth of their Conversion, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation meerly upon this Account, because they were brought home to God by weeping-Cross, because it was by these things, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> By Divine Punishments, that their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was wrought, or brought about; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, let them go on chearfully in a Christian Course, nothing doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but Rejoycing in the Lord always, and with hearts continually lifted up in the ways of the Lord, which was the Commendation of King <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> 2 Chron. 17.6.

What then? notwithstanding every way, whether without these things, or by these things, by Punishment, or without Punishment sinners are Reformed and won to Christ, and I therein therefore do rejoyce, yea, and I will rejoyce; yea, and let the Convert himself therein rejoyce; yea, let the Angels in Heaven therein rejoyce, even as they do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce: <hi>For,</hi> says our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10. <hi>There is Joy in the Presence of the Angels of God over one sinner that Repenteth,</hi> implying, let the means inducing him truly to Repent, be what it will, though it were by means of fore Affliction (as it was in the Case of the Prodigal, the Parable of whom is Related in the Verses immediately following) <hi>Yet there is Joy in the Presence of the Angels of God over one such sinner,</hi> one such Prodigal, <hi>that Repenteth</hi> by such means.</p>

                  <hi>Caution.</hi> Let none, especially of my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in the Ministry, accuse me as a Legal Preacher upon Account of what I have said in this Use, or Section, whereby to Vindicate

As God said, by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Chap. 2.34. <hi>(In thy Skirts is found the blood of the Souls of the poor Innocents; I have not found it upon secret search, but upon all these.)</hi> In like sort may it be said, concerning the sins of our Nation, They may be found without secret search, in our skirts are they found; they are written in our Fore-heads, they testifie to our Faces, they are visible as the Light at Noon-day: O how
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48664:76"/> many do declare their sin, as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and hide it not! <hi>Esay</hi> 3.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What Family-Reformation is there? How few <hi>Jacobs</hi> are there, who have endeavoured to cleanse their Houses of that wickedness, that from Father to Son hath still kept the Possession! <hi>Gen.</hi> 35. <hi>begin.</hi> How doth the Leprosie of sin stick as close to Mens Dwellings, especially the Palaces and Mansions of great Persons, as ever before! Yea, how many Families are much worse than before! Time was, when it might have been said of such and such Families, There had wont to be daily Praying in this House, Reading the Scriptures, Repeating Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Singing Psalms, Catechising Children and Servants â€” But what's become now of all this? Some are become Sectaries, some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, some meer Worldlings, some Papists, some Atheists â€” Briefly, as the Prophet said of <hi>Israel,</hi> Hos. 8.3. So it may be sadly said of too too many Families, They have cast off the thing that is good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Examine, what Personal Reformation is there: Let every Man lay the hand upon his own Breast, and smite upon his Thigh, saying, Have I been Reformed by these Things? A needful Exhortation; for we all have too much of the Hypocrite in us: I mean, we are quick-sighted to espie faults, though lesser, in others, but to take no notice, even of greater, in our
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48664:76"/> selves. We can vociferate, cry aloud against the sins of others (Court, City, Magistrates â€”) make declamations <hi>(O Tempora! O Mores!)</hi> But who is it, or how few are there, who do consider themselves? Well may I say, with that Heathen Poet, <hi>Æ²t nemo in sese tentat descendere, nemo?</hi> Or rather I will say, with the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. <hi>There is none that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth him of his sin, saying, What have I done?</hi> Many complain of the doings of others; they can tell what others have done, though it was done long since; but few do in penitent sort say, <hi>What have I done?</hi> They are apt enough to tell of the good they have done, and to pride themselves in it, as did the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> saying, <hi>God, I thank thee, I am not as other Men are</hi> â€” Yea, they are apt to speak of the good they have not done, as <hi>Saul</hi> did. But few do consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, saying to themselves, What, what have I done? What good have I left undone? Let us be Exhorted then in the midst of those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, which may every where be heard against the sinfulness of the Times, to say to our selves, as the Prophet <hi>Obed</hi> did to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Israel</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.10. <hi>Are there not with You, even with You, sins against the Lord your God?</hi>) Thus let every one say, Are there not sins with Me, even with Me, against the Lord our God? Or, as <hi>Nathan</hi> said to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid (Tu es homo;)</hi> So let every one say to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48664:77"/> himself, Am not I the Person, who am not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by These Things?</p>

A little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration will suffice to know what we should do in this Case, even the consideration of this one Text in hand, <hi>(If ye will not be Reformed by these things.)</hi> Reformation is the work to be done by us, and that therefore is it which I shall exhort you unto, and I will do it in the words of Scripture: First, in the words of our

Know and Consider the following particulars, which I am to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest and make known to you, as things which we should have done, and then consider what we have to do.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Know, and Consider, That our Primary Duty was, to have been Reformed before, and without these Things <hi>(i. e.)</hi> without Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and before the Judgments of God were poured forth upon us.

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:48664:79"/> us! O how should sinners be affected to hear the intreaties and obsecrations of Chri t, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as <hi>Saul,</hi> upon the hearing of <hi>David</hi> s cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out unto him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Is this thy Voyce, my Son</hi> David? Is this thy Voyce, my sweet Saviour? Is it the Saviour indeed that doth beseech the sinner to be Reconciled? what less should a sinner do at the hearing of this, than <hi>Saul</hi> did upon the fore-cited Occasion, of whom it is said, <hi>And</hi> Saul <hi>lifted up his Voyce, and wept.</hi> Thus, I say, we should have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without, and before these things, even upon the hearing of Gods Word. See <hi>Zech.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Should ye not hear the words, which the Lord hath cryed by the former Prophets, when</hi> Jerusalem <hi>was Inhabited, and in Prosperity, and the Cities thereof round about her?</hi> Mark those words [In Prosperity] In allusion to those words of the Prophet, may it not be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to us, should we have heard the words of the Lord, by the Mouth of his Ministers, while our Houses were standing, our Trading was quick, our Arms and Armies were more dreaded, our <hi>Jerusalem</hi> flourished, our Church un-divided, our Nation at Unity within it self, when we went together to the House of God as Friends?</p>
               <p n="2">2. We should have Reformed by other things, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> By Punishments threatned, as <hi>Niniveh</hi> did. This is that which God exhorts
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48664:79"/> unto by the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> Chap. 2. <hi>beg. Gather your selves together; yea, gather your selves together, O Nation not desired.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Having not been Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Gods still, small Voyce, Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and beseeching us, we should have reformed by his voice Thundring, &amp; Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in his Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</note>
                  <hi>Before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree bring forth, Before the day pass as the Chaff, Before the sierce Anger of the Lord come upon you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Anger of the Lord come upon you.</hi> Observe the word <hi>[Before]</hi> four times repeated. I have at large in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the first point of Doctrine, spoken of this Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the timely heeding of Gods warnings by his Threatnings before they be Executed, and therefore I need say less here as to that Matter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We should have Reformed by the sight and hearing of Gods Judgments Executed on others. This God expects, saying, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3. 6, 7. <hi>I have cut off the Nations, their Towns are Desolate, I have made their streets waste, that none passeth by â€” I said, surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive Instruction.</hi> This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is according to the Mind of God, who in punishing of sinners, designs, not onely the Reformation of them who suffer, but of others also, who possibly may behold, or hear of the same, as hath been upon Occasion before said and proved. Thence it is said of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:48664:80"/> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> that by the notorious way of their perishing, They became a sign, <hi>Numb.</hi> 26.10. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a Monument, a Spectacle, or an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Divine Vengeance to warn others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We should have been Reformed by les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, by fewer punishments, before it came to seven times more for our sins. Therefore doth God send lesser Judgments, that these being well improved, greater Judgments may be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Thus and thus we should have done, but because it is too late, and to less purpose, to consider onely what we should, but have not done; therefore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, and more especially let us know and consider what we have to do for the future, <hi>viz.</hi> If we have not been Reformed by other things (by Advice and Counsel, by Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, by the sight of Divine Vengeance Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted upon others, by lesser Judgments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon our selves heretofore) at least, at last, let me say, <hi>Let us be Reformed by these Things, (i. e.)</hi> the seven times more, that hath been added to our former Sufferings. It is said in <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.8. concerning the <hi>Egyptians, That if they did not hearken to the Voyce of the first sign, they would hearken to the Second.</hi> These signs were Plagues, or so many several strokes of Divine Vengeance: And Gods Rods have a Voyce (<hi>Mic.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Hear the Rod.</hi>) Now, forasmuch as we have not hearkned to the voyce
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48664:80"/> of one Judgment, of former, of lesser Judgments, let us not harden our hearts more than the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> but let us hearken to the voyce of latter signs, of our farther, present punishments.</p>
               <p>Know and Consider these two things, <hi>viz.</hi> That nothing less than Reformation will serve, either our turn, or Gods turn (as I may so say) I mean, that will please God, or profit us. <hi>e. g.</hi> It is not the external formal Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a solemn Fast; yea, many such Fasting days: It is not many Prayers, short or long Prayers; it is not the putting on of Mournful Apparel, the spreading Sackcloath and Ashes under us; it is not meer Vows and Promises of Reformation, that will please God (he will not be put off in that sort, with such Pageantry and mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>kers) or that will secure us from seven times more for our sins. See at large by what we may read at leisure, in <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Esay</hi> 1.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. and 58.5, 6. How little God doth regard all that come short of washing and cleansing (<hi>Esay</hi> 1.16.) short of a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in what little, or no stead such things will stand a sinful Nation. I shall then conclude this Exhortation with the words of God by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Chap. 6.8. <hi>Be thou Instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, O</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>lest my Soul depart from thee;</hi> and the rather with these words, because the word in my Text, which is Translated [Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed] doth sig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48664:81"/> to both which rendrings of the word, let me say, yea, let us imagine God himself saying to us, Be thou Instructed, be thou Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, O Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> lest my Soul depart from thee.</p>

Our Reformation should be not barely a promised Reformation, a Reformation in word and Tongue (to speak in the Language of St. <hi>John,</hi> 1.3.18.) but in Deed, and in Truth. The renewing of our Promises and Covenant with God is one Duty pertaining to the Holy Observation of a Solemn Fast, for which we have a Pattern of Gods Church of O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.1. <hi>with last.</hi> But what are Promises with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Performances? To promise, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, is but <hi>Verba dare,</hi> to seek to couzen, and to mock God, and wherein indeed we do but deceive our selves; <hi>For God is not mocked,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7. When I say then, that our Reformation should be a real Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, I mean, it should not be Verbal onely; and therefore to such a real Reformation I shall exhort you in the words of the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 76.11. <hi>Vow, and Pay to the Lord your God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It must be, not barely an out-side, but an in-side Reformation; for Truth is in the inward parts: and this is it, which God desireth, saith the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> in that his Penitential <hi>Psalm,</hi> Psal. 51.6.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pharisees</hi> had an out-side Reformation, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.39. But woe, notwithstanding, and woe again, says our Saviour, to such Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Reformers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.25. Be then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted in the words of St. <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 9.8. <hi>Cleanse your Hands, ye Sinners, and Purifie
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48664:82"/> your Hearts, ye double-minded.</hi> Observe, hands and heart; not hands onely, but hearts also. I cannot say to you in this Case, as our Saviour said to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in another <hi>John</hi> 13.9. <hi>He that is washed, needeth not, save to wash his feet</hi> (his Hands, his out-side) but is clean every whit; yea, I must say the contrary: We need both washings (Hands and Heart, out-side and in-side) Yea, and the true Nature of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation I am speaking of, doth need, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It must be well grounded, <hi>viz.</hi> Upon a good Conscience, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a Conscience of Gods Command, and not meerly upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of any Man, or Men. A Reformation thus grounded, or Founded, is that which we call a true, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> a Morally true, or sincere Reformation. That Reformation is in Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity no true Reformation, that is not thus groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> it is not sincere and upright. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Reformation, which was made by the People, under the Reign of those two Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Kings of <hi>Judah, (Asa</hi> and <hi>Josiah</hi>) did very much fail, as to a great part of the Body of the Nation, as appears, not onely by the Chronicle of those times, but also by the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Prophets that were contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with those Pious Princes; for it was more out of fear of Man, and Respect to Humane Ordinances, than out of the fear of God, and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48664:82"/> Conscience of his Command, that the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the People did submit as they did, and thence was their after-revolt upon the Death of those Godly Kings. I shall then Exhort you in the same words as St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort Christian Servants, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto Men.</hi> Whatsoever we Reform, let it be as upon the Command of God, and not of Man meerly.

Or of whom? <hi>Answ.</hi> It is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Laws, not of Lives so much; they would have the Laws reformed (this Law, &amp; that Law, and t'other Law, Ecclesiastical Law, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, Civil Law-reformed) but in the mean while they are less sollicitous for the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Lawless Lives and manner of mis-living.

                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:48664:83"/> we have heard of the <hi>Centum Gravamina</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> at the beginning of the Reformation, Presented (as I Remember) in some of their Diets, to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, in Order to a redress. I beseech the Lord to make our King and Parliament wise as the Angels of God, to Judge rightly, what Laws of any kind are to be numbred among the <hi>Gravamina</hi> complained of; and having found them out, that they would remove them, as so many pricking Bryars, and grieving Thorns to the <hi>Israel</hi> of God. But these two things, I say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if our Lives were but Reformed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Laws, we should be an Happy People: Oh, by how many degrees more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than we are, or are ever like to be, as now Lawless in our Lives we are!</p>
               <p n="2">2. The onely way to have our Laws Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (so far as Reason of State will permit) is to reform our Lives; if we would take care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the one,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Joel <hi>2.18, 19, 20.</hi> Then will the Lord be Jealous for his Land, and pity his People. Yea, the Lord â€” <hi>Psal. 81.13, 14.</hi> O that my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had hearkened to my Voyce â€” I should soon have â€”</note> God would find out one blessed way or other by his good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to reform the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he having the Hearts of King and Parliament in his own Hand, turning them as the Rivers of water as he pleaseth. But our sin and misery is, that the reformation of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48664:84"/> Lives is that which we are less mindful of, and sollicitous for. Or if it be a reformation of Lives that is meant by the Common cry for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and out-cry for want of it; Of whose reformation, or of whom, think we, is this noyse by the most intended? Surely of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of others, rather than of themselves, as if others onely had need to be reformed, but the Common Cryer himself had no need at all. We would have all reformed but One, and that is our selves; we would have all things reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both in Church and State, but as to what is amiss in our own Breasts and Bosoms, in our own Lives and Conversations, we mind or care for no such thing. The Laity would have the Clergy reformed, and the Clergy the Laity; the Commonalty would have the Gentry refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the Gentry the Commonalty; the Rich the Poor, and the Poor the Rich; and thus we run round. So that if it be said, That every man is a reformer, and yet no man is a reformer, it is not such a riddle, but that it may easily be unfolded, and Interpreted according to what hath been already said. It is not then without cause, or more than needs, that I should again and again exhort and excite you, and that in the first place to this Personal reformation. Let us all, from the highest to the lowest, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Joshua,</hi> saying, <hi>I and my House will serve the Lord,</hi> Josh. 24.15. Mark, I, and I in the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48664:84"/> fore-front. Let every one first of all, and most of all see to himself. The Apostle exhorts the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> (1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4.11.) <hi>That they would all study to be quiet, and to do</hi>

                  </gap>
                  <hi>their own business, their proper work.</hi> A most memorable Scripture upon many accounts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating among other things, that as one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Peoples unquietness, is, because they do not study quietness; so another is, because they do not confine themselves to their own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, but are busie-bodies in other mens Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But the reason of my quoting that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is to take Occasion from thence to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you, that self-reformation is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, every ones own business, the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>per work of every one, and as for other reasons by and by to be specified; so for that Reason in the first place, I shall exhort you to study it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Inasmuch as God hath made it our own business, and that unquestionably. It is a Question in many cases, how far forth it is our business to Reform another, but it is out of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that self-reformation is my own proper work; for as for this work, every Man can do it best, and is bound to do it most.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Every Man can do it best; forasmuch as it is much more in a Mans power to Reform himself, than another; a Man having more Command also of himself, than he hath of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It's true indeed, that without G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ds
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48664:85"/> help and assistance we can do neither: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord help, how can we help, may we say in this case, even as did the King of <hi>Israel</hi> in another, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.27. Thence that Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Ephraim</hi> to God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. <hi>Turn thou me, and I shall be turned.</hi> Yet the one may be more easie comparatively with the other, as having less impediments than the other, and for that cause may be said to be most in a Mans pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; as also because a Man may have that store of means in his own power to make use of at his pleasure, for the Reforming of himself, which are not in his power to use for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of another, as might be instanced in, were it not over-much to enlarge this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. And thence it is, that if we speak of self-reformation, it may be truly said, that a Man may save himself, if he will, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> if he had a predominant will, or were prevalently desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to do it, or had not a Will prepondera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the contrary; but it cannot be thus said with respect to the Saving, or Reforming of another. How sincerely, cordially, earnestly, vehemently willing were the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to Reform them, that never were, nor would be Reformed. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>beg.</hi> and 10. <hi>beg.</hi> The like proportionably may be said of the flagrant desires of Gods faithful Ministers and Pious Parents, for the Reforming of their People and Children, which it never was in their
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48664:85"/> power to effect notwithstanding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every Man is bound to do it most. This doth in some sort follow from the former: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, <hi>Tunica pallio proprior,</hi> as the Proverbs have it, every Man is nearest to himself, is more concerned in his own woe, or welfare, than of another single Person. Thence it is, that it is made a Ministers first work, to see to the saving of himself, and then of those that hear him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.16. and of this, see how careful St. <hi>Paul</hi> was by that his saying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>lat. I keep down my Body, and bring it into Subjection, lest that by any means, when I have Preached to others, I my self should be a cast-away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To perswade you to this work of Self-reforming, in the first place, consider, that till we have Reformed our selves, we are less likely to Reform others, though we should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it. I do not say, it is impossible (<hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> might possibly Convert a sinner to the Faith of Christ) but it is improbable, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rare, that God doth so far succeed with his blessing the Labours of a wicked Minister to the saving of Souls. And the Reason, or Reasons hereof are so obvious, that to name them would be to less purpose.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The very attempting to reform another, is a very shame to, or in him, who hath not Reformed himself; for how doth he expose
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48664:86"/> himself by so doing unto that Reproach, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Thou that Teachest another, Teachest thou not thy self?</hi> Thou, Thou, Thou, Thou â€” And <hi>Medice cura teipsum.</hi> That which is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and gracious work in another, is shameful and unbeseeming work in the Person I am speaking of; it doth no more become him, than a Jewel doth a Swines snout, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs of <hi>Solomon</hi> hath it;
<q>Turpe est doctori cum culpa redarguit ipsum.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Consider, That if every sinner would stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do this his own work of self-reformation, it would prove the most effectual way to be quiet. Did every one of us study to do <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, this his own business, no man needs to study to be quiet; for quietness would follow of it self, even <hi>per Modum resultantiae,</hi> a meer Physical, rather than as at all a Moral effect, or (to speak in the words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Esay,</hi> Chap. 32.17.) <hi>The work, of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness would be Peace, and the effect of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness Quietness and Assurance for ever.</hi> And oh what an happy thing is it to be Quiet? Oh for a Quiet World! Oh for Quiet Times! <hi>Da pacem Domine, da pacem.</hi> O thou Divine Blessing, Quietness! Thou Heaven upon Earth! Let it be said of Peace, as it once was said con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Name, who was the Prince of Peace, Thou art <hi>Mel in Ore, Melos in aure, &amp; Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum in corde.</hi> Would we Inherit this Divine
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48664:86"/> Blessing of Peace and Quietness, let us follow and study Personal Holiness, Personal Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. And till we do this, let us never look for a Quiet World, for Quiet Times: For the very studying to Reform others, while we take no care to Reform our selves, doth but dis-set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle things, and disquiet both Church and State.</p>

               <p n="3">3. BE Exhorted to endeavour a Publique Reformation. The Truth is, that if every Man and Woman would men One, then this Exhortation would be altogether needless, for thereupon all would be mended, according to the Common saying, If every one would sweep before their own Door, the whole Street and Town would be clean. But because it may rationally be presumed, that many things as to the Publique, will be still crooked and amiss, which will have need of rectifying: Let us all in our Places and Callings do as we can for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation there. To this End some Persons can do but little, but other Persons may do much, and both sorts are to be excited to do what they can.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some are in a Capacity to do much more than others can, <hi>viz.</hi> Publique Persons, such as are in Publique place, briefly (to speak in the Language of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2.) <hi>Kings and all that are</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> What should these do for a Publique Reformation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In short, They should do their Office,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48664:89"/> or what doth pertain to them in their Publique Capacity. In this Answer somewhat is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, which <hi>I</hi> do not therefore mention, <hi>viz.</hi> That these Governours, whether Supreme or Subordinate, do themselves keep the Law, and do give a good Example in their own Persons, <hi>e. g.</hi> That they are no Swearers, Drunkards, Whore-mongers, Extortioners, Neglecters, and Prophaners of the Lords Day, his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; â€” This being supposed, it is enough to Answer as before. They are to do their proper Office, and <hi>I</hi> can say no less than this: For it is not enough for Governours to give a good Example in their own Persons, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law so far as belongs to them in their Private Capacity, or as in Common with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but they must also do what concerns them as Publique Persons: That is, they must see as much as in them lyes, that the Law be Executed, they being sent both by God and the King, for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well, as St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> says expresly, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. And if Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of all sorts, Civil and Ecclesiastical, from the highest to the lowest, would do as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> would be Patterns of Vertue and Piety in their own Persons, well governing themselves in the first place, and then as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours would be impartial in the Execution of Justice, punishing evil doers, and encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48664:89"/> them that do well. O what a Blessed, what a Publique Reformation would quickly ensue! But when Rulers are wicked, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set in place to Judge others after the Law, do themselves notoriously contrary to the Law; or, as <hi>Gallio,</hi> are altogether careless to Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Office: What shall I say, but this? <hi>Conclamatum est,</hi> as to a Publique Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To him, who would shew himself a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitour for such a Reformation, I would say, with him, in the Comedy, <hi>Actum est, illicet,</hi> you may spare your pains, there is no hope; Past Cure, past Care. Let me then, in the Name of the most high God (who is <hi>Rex Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum, &amp; Dominus Dominantium</hi>) Exhort and beseech all sorts of Governours to do their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. He that Ruleth Men, should be Just, Ruling in the fear of God, said he, who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was a Ruler, even the Annoynted of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the sweet <hi>Psalmist</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> as he stiles himself, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.1, 3. Now, for Rulers to do their Office, is to be Just; let them do it then, and let them do it in the fear of God. Let it not be said, that ye bear the Sword in vain: Be ye a Terror to evil works, and workers of all sorts: If possible, let no Sons of <hi>Zerviah</hi> be too strong for you. Woe to that Kingdom or Nation where Lawless Persons have onely got the Bitt in their mouths. I will therefore Conclude my Exhortation briefly, in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48664:90"/> allusion to those words of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6, 7, 8. where as he exhorts respectively to the Diversity of Gifts, so shall I exhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. As for another sort of Persons, they can do but little comparatively towards a Publique Reformation, and by these, I mean Private Persons, who have no such Office as aforesaid. These have but a single Talent, a Widdows Mite, as I may so say.

Smite with your Hand, and stamp with your Foot, and cry alas, for the evil Abominations of the Times, whethether in Laity, or Clergy, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 6.11.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48664:91"/> Prayers, Intercessions, and giving of Thanks be made for all Men; For Kings, and for all that are in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godliness and Honesty.</hi> And Observe the Apostles Reason, whereby to excite us, he saying, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.</hi> It is ill, when things are amiss in Church and State, to Swear and Curse, to rail and revile, it is un-acceptable both to God and Man; but to pray, this indeed is good (we have the suffrage of the Apostle for it) this is Acceptable, as well in the sight of Man (of Men our Governours) as in the sight of God our Saviour. And therefore <hi>I</hi> shall conclude this Matter, saying, with the same Apostle else-where, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Bless, and Curse not. I</hi> say, Curse not; for even this, when our Passion boyls, and in a fretting Humour are sinners apt to do, looking upward to Curse their King and their God, <hi>Esay</hi> 8.21. Let us weeping then, not Curse but bless; knowing (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> says, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.) <hi>That hereunto we were Called, that we may Inherit a Blessing,</hi> that Blessing of Blessings, that Blessed Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as to the publique; to the promoting whereof, I have here more at large exhorted all Persons of all sorts in their places and Callings, to contribute their Christian Endeavours.</p>

               <p n="3">3. I Come now to a Third Qualification of the Reformation in hand, <hi>viz.</hi> It should be an Impartial, or a Universal Reformation, not of this or that particular sin onely, but of whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is apparent to us to be such. Our Impunity doth depend upon the doing, not of some onely, but upon the doing of all Gods Commandments. This is apparent by the 14. and 15 verses of this 26 Chapter of <hi>Leviticus, But if ye will not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to me, and will not do all these Commandments; And if ye shall despise my Statutes, or if your Soul abhor my Judgments, so that ye will not do all my Commandments, but that ye break my Covenant.</hi> From these words is Observable, not onely that as to the Qualification of our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to God it ought to be impartial and Universal (to all Gods Commandments) but it is further Observable, That to do some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God, and not make Conscience of all, is not to hearken to God, and it is also to break Covenant with God. He is one that stops his Ears against God, and breaks Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, who doing some Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, doth abhor the doing of others. A Universal Reformation therefore, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of one sin as well as another, is that, which I am in this place to Direct and Exhort
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48664:92"/> you unto. This is that Reformation, which God doth by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> Exhort unto, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.30. And I shall exhort you in the self-same words, <hi>Repent, and turn your selves from all your Transgressions;</hi> and v. 31. <hi>Cast away from you all your Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, whereby you have Transgressed.</hi> This is the way to prevent seven times more for our sins: For, says the Prophet in that self-same place, <hi>So Iniquity shall not be your Ruine.</hi> It was <hi>Jehu</hi>'s defect, and that which was the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of him and his Posterity, that he was but a partial Reformer, and partially Reformed; onely so far as concerned the Idolatry of the House of <hi>Ahab,</hi> still serving his State-Interest, in retaining, and upholding the sin of <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> Contrary was that Reformation of <hi>Josiah,</hi> for which by the King of Kings he is Commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.25. <hi>And like unto him was there no King before him, that turned to the Lord with all his Heart, and with all his Soul, and with all his Might, according to all the Law of</hi> Moses. Such a Personal Reformer was <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 119.67. <hi>Before I was Afflicted,</hi> says he, <hi>I went astray, but now have I kept thy Word,</hi> (i. e.) not onely this or that part of Gods Word, but his Word, <hi>in toto, ac in solido,</hi> his whole Word, having respect unto all Gods Commandments, as is his Expression, <hi>v.</hi> 6. the thing for which God Commends him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48664:92"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 13.22. <hi>I have found</hi> David <hi>after my own heart, that shall fulfill</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>All my Evils.</hi> Thus to do is to do after Gods own heart. And this is that Reformation which I do Exhort unto; but withal suggesting and saying, Let our Reformation be such, as that it may not onely be stiled <hi>(absolute loquendo)</hi> Universal, but that in some respects it may be also styled special: I mean, let us Reform some more special sins, which I shall instance in, as calling for a special Reformation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Your <hi>Diana</hi>-sins, your <hi>Isaac</hi>'s, your <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilahs,</hi> your <hi>Agag</hi>'s, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Your most belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved sins, your Kingly Corruptions, those to which you have been most enslaved, such as by the pleasures and profit whereof you have been hitherto most besotted, and bewitched, any wicked Course of Life, whereby, like <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> and his Crafts-men, you have had your <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, made an Advantage, and been gainers in the World. These kind of sins for the most part are secret from the Eye of the World, and for that reason also sinners may have need of a special remembrance to reform these. Let us remember, that as when we pray, so also when we sin, we sin against our Heavenly Father, who sees in secret, and will reward us open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let our reformation be especially of more notorious and scandalous sins. In the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48664:93"/> Name of God let scandals be reformed. O cease to declare your sins, as <hi>Sodom,</hi> and hide them for shame; hide them for your own sake, and hide them for Gods sake, and the honour of the Gospel, that the Name of Christ and his Doctrine be not Blasphemed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let our Reformation be of such sins as are in their own Nature (however separated, or abstracted from scandal) more hainous. As there be <hi>Magnalia Legis,</hi> so there be <hi>Magnalia contra Legem,</hi> Sins of great repugnancy to the Divine Law. And as all sin is more or less contrary to God, so the greater the sin is, the greater is its contrariety unto him. Some sins are called great Provocations [<hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.18.26. <hi>They wrought great Provocations,</hi>] Bitter Provocations, (<hi>Hos.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Ephraim Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Lord to Anger most bitterly.</hi>) Mighty sins, (<hi>Amos</hi> 5.12. <hi>I know your manifold Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and your Mighty sins.</hi>) Wonderful and horrible sins (<hi>Jer.</hi> 5. <hi>lat. A Wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the Land.</hi>) Grievous sins (<hi>Lam.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned.</hi>) And whose cry is like the cry of the sins of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> of which the Lord himself (being disquieted therewith) says, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.20. <hi>That it was great and very grievous.</hi> What these kind of sins are, not onely the Light without us and about us (<hi>I</hi> mean, the Holy Scripture) but the Light within us doth
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48664:93"/> Discover; this is known by Natural, but more abundantly by Super-natural Revelation. O let us be exhorted to cease from such. As our Saviour says, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.16. <hi>When ye Fast, be not as the Hypocrites:</hi> In like sort do I Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish you, saying, When ye Reform, be not as the Hypocrites, do not as the Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>Pharisees</hi> did, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Do not strain at Gnats, and swallow Camels, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Do not pretend Conscience of avoyding lesser sins (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Vestures, Gestures, Ceremonies) in the mean time making no bones, no scruple of great sins, living in the neglect of the great things of Gods Law, Judgment, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Faith, the Love of God, and the Love of your Brethren.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Let there be a special Reformation of those sins, whereby more especially and visibly God hath been provoked to punish us seven times <hi>(i. e.)</hi> much more than formerly. These oft-times before Judgments be inflicted are most apparent, and written as in Letters Capital, if I may so say, in allusion to those words of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> (Chap. 17.1. <hi>The sin of Judah is written with a Pen of Iron, and with the Point of a Diamond, it is graven vpon the Horns of your Altars.</hi>) In which sence there be those, who would have that Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apostle to be understood, he saying (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Some mens sins are open before-hand,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48664:94"/> going before to Judgment.</hi>) What these sins are it is not for a great part hard to say. Our Consciences, though at other times asleep, yet being awakened with the Vengeance of God, will at such a time be upon our backs, rating us in such sort, as <hi>Reuben</hi> did his Brethren, saying, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.21, 22. <hi>We are verily guilty concerning our Brother;</hi> â€” You have been thus, and thus, and thus guilty; and as <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi> concludes the charge, saying, <hi>Therefore his Blood is required;</hi> such is the Conclusion of an accusing Conscience; <hi>Therefore this, this and this heavy distress and punishment is upon us.</hi> Read the Confession of sinners under their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.7. <hi>Our Iniquities testifie against us.</hi> And <hi>Esay</hi> 59 12. <hi>Our Transgressions are multiplyed before thee, and our sins testifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us; for our Transgressions are with us, and as for our Iniquities we know them,</hi> (i. e.) Not barely know what they are, but also what mischief they have done us, and the evils which they have brought upon us. Let us then be exhorted to a special Reformation of all such known sins; sins we do know, and cannot but know (if we will believe our own Consciences) to have been the cause of our sufferings. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the Sermons of the Prophets, and we shall find, that therein they do all along exhort the People (high and low, Prince, Priest, and People) to Reform such sins, as afore-said,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48664:94"/> which because it is of Observation so frequent and obvious, I will therefore forbear to quote particular places in their Sermons.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Reform especially in your selves the sins of the Times, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> such sins as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men and Women in the places where you live are guilty of. This is a needful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, as for other Reasons, so for this, <hi>viz.</hi> Such sins, because Common are accounted as no sins at all, or next to none; or, as <hi>Lot</hi> said of <hi>Zoar,</hi> little ones; and which may therefore be (as Men are apt to think) well tolerated and excused from Reformation. If a sin be in Fashion, who makes account the Fashion to be a sin? Whatever is the garb of the Times, we are apt to think it warrantable upon that very account, however unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it be otherwise to Scripture, Reason, and Common sence. Although as Christians at our solemn Initiation we have forsworn the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, yet how apt are we to follow the World there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? And after all, like the Adulteress in <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.20. <hi>To wipe our mouths, and say, we have done no wickedness.</hi> But let such vain Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations be far from us, and let us make full account, as the very Truth is, That a sin by how much it is more Common, by so much it is the more grievously provoking to God, and hasteneth Judgments the sooner, and ripening
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48664:95"/> sinners for Divine Vengeance, as might easily be proved by several Scriptures, and the thing it self be exemplified by the Destruction of the Old World by Water, of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> by Fire, and of <hi>Israel</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> by the Sword, for which, see <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.12, 13. and 19.9. and 18.33. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.13. and 7.9. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.11. O then let there be a special Reformation of National sins: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Walk blameless and harmless as the Children of God without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion â€” H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If the wicked multitude shall sollicite us to any evil, saying, with those Enticers (<hi>Prov.</hi> 1.11.) <hi>Come with us:</hi> Let us remember the inhibition, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.3. <hi>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil.</hi> Imitate <hi>Noah</hi> (a Man of the Old World) who had this Testimony from God, That he was Ju t and Upright in his Generaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and one that walked with God, when the whole World was drown'd in sin, and for sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9.

               <p n="6">6. Let our Reformation be positive as well
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48664:96"/> as privative, I mean, Let us Reform, not onely as to sins of Commission, but also as to sins of Omission; let us not onely put off the Old Man, but put on the New Man also, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22, 23. <hi>Let us not onely cast off the works of darkness, but let us put on the Armour of Light,</hi> Rom. 13.12. <hi>Josiah</hi> is a worthy pattern for this kind of Reformation; for as he did pull down one kind of Worship [Idol-worship] so he did set up another kind of Worship, the Worship of the true God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. <hi>last.</hi> The like Reforming King was <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> what worship he pull'd down, is recorded in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. <hi>the beginning of the Chapter;</hi> and what worship he did set up, we read in the latter end thereof. As our Saviour therefore said in the close of the Parable of the good <hi>Samaritan, Ito tu, fac similiter,</hi> so I say to every Person of what rank soever, <hi>Go, and do thou likewise.</hi> This is a Uniform Reformation. And we have many Acts upon Record in the Book of God, I mean, Divine Statutes, or strict Commands from God (the onely Law-giver, who is able to save, and to destroy) for such a Uniformity; I will rehearse some of them in your hearing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.29. <hi>Let no Corrupt Communication pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of your mouth, but that which is good, to the use of Edifying, that it may minister grace to the Hearers.</hi> O for Conformity to this Act!

Consider the Common Proverb, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we say no less truly, than usually, Delays are dangerous; and if in any thing, even in things of common concernment, how much more in the thing I am now Exhorting unto, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is of such moment and consequence, I may therefore style it the <hi>Æ²num necessarium,</hi> The One thing needful. Delays in any thing are like to prove to our cost, and much more in this. Consider the mischiefs, the manifold mischiefs of delays in the present Case; mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, I mean, whether certain, or possible at least, <hi>e. g.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It may be truly said, Now, or never, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> Possibly never. For now is the time for Reformation. Now is the accepted time; Now is the day of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lvation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. Yet a little while, and we shall be past Reforming, as hath been already intimated in the handling
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48664:98"/> of the first point of Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the certain mischiefs are,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That our delays will cost us dear, in that they will provoke God to punish us seven times more for our sin; so that if we get any thing by our delay of Reforming, it will be blows, and nothing but blows; blows upon blows, shame upon shame, losses upon losses â€” So that as is said (<hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. <hi>He that it filthy let him be filthy still,</hi> (i. e.) at his peril be it.) In like sort do I say in the present case, He that delays his Reformation, let him delay it still, but at his own peril be it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The longer we delay our Reforming, the farther and farther off still and still we shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be, and that upon a manifold ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We shall have less mind and heart to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We shall have less Power and strength to do it: For sin doth besott, bewitch, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeble the sinner. <hi>Whoredome, and Wine, and New Wine take away the Heart,</hi> Hos. 4.11. And sin through its deceitfulness will more and more harden the sinner, and indispose him to a Reformation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As for Impediments from without, they will still be the same, or increase and grow upon us. As St. <hi>Paul</hi> said in another Case (2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.7. <hi>He who now letteth, will let, till
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48664:98"/> he be taken out of the way.</hi>) In like sort may it be said, That those lets and Temptations, that do now let and hinder our Reformation, will hinder it, till by resistance and Victory they be taken out of the way. Yea, impediments by Reason of our delays will grow upon us, even as Neighbour Enemies will more and more multiply against a Nation, when they do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their weaknesses, security, neglect to stand upon their Guard, unpreparedness for their own Defence, irresolution, and the like. O then, let no sinner content himself with bare purposes and promises of Reformation. As our Saviour said to his Disciples, <hi>If ye Love them that Love you, what do you more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</hi> In like sort shall I say to you, If being under the Afflicting Hand of God, you do purpose onely, and promise that ye will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, what do you more than others? Than those Hypocrites, of whom it is said (<hi>Psal.</hi> 78.36.) that by their promises they did but Flatter him with their Lips, and lyed unto him with their Tongues. Yea, if we do onely promise to Reform, what do we more than hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who being under the Plagues of God, did promise and protest, saying to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> (Exod. 9.28. <hi>Intreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty Thundrings and Hail, and I will let you go.</hi>) Nor was this the first Promise that he
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48664:99"/> made upon this Occasion; for he promised it before upon the like Occasion once and again, as appears by the fore-going Chapters. Let sinners then be Exhorted without delay to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. We have long and long already put off God with Promises and Purposes of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the thing it self being still delayed; now therefore let us delay no longer. Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to the sinner touching his Reformation, is of the same tenour as was that of the Father to his Son, saying, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 21.28. <hi>Son, go work</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

I Conclude this Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with the words of the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.7.15. <hi>To Day if ye will hear his Voyce</hi> (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon you to Reform) <hi>harden not your Hearts.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. I Come now to the Second kind of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection promised to be insisted upon, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> A Direction to such means as are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively conducing to that Reformation which I have so largely opened in the Nature thereof, and exhorted unto; and herein I do judge, that very, much of sure and sound Direction may be gathered from the words of my Text, and which I will endeavour to improve to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost, by keeping close to it (as <hi>Ruth</hi> did to <hi>Boaz</hi> his Reapers) and as little expatiating from it into any other Field, as well may be. And in the first place I shall think meet to give you Notice of the main Impediments to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and Admonishing you to take heed of them, and to remove them out of the way. I will as I go along acquaint you with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Prescripts or Remedies to be made use of. Know then, that the main Impediments to the reformation of sinners under the Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hand of God, and the common causes of Incorrigibleness, are such as these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not considering the Author of our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, who it is that doth punish us, not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to Gods hand, as therein lifted up; look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them as coming of Course, by Chance, or Fortune; or at least, looking no farther than
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48664:101"/> those who are the Instruments of our Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Three things are here to be proved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That if we are punished, it is God who doth punish us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is our common fault, that we look not up to the Hand of God in that Case.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this is a main Cause of our Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigibleness.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As for the first particular, it is of easie proof, and I have already spoken unto it (as a thing implyed in my Text) in the first branch of the Use of Information, for which cause I need say little or nothing more to it in this place, but refer you to what hath been already said in that its proper place. Onely I shall instance in certain particular punishments, whereby sinners are sometimes punished, and shew you, how Scripture doth still ascribe them to God, or Divine Providence, <hi>e. g.</hi> [To let pass Plague and Pestilence, Drought and Famine, Fire and Sword] Are we punished by home-divisions and intestine Wars? See whence this is, <hi>Esay</hi> 19.2. <hi>I will,</hi> says God, <hi>set the</hi> Egyptians <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and they shall Fight eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one against his Brother, and every one against his Neighbour; City against City, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom against Kingdom. And,</hi> says God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.14. <hi>I will dash them one against another.</hi> Is it by the Rebellion of their Subjects that Princes do suffer at Home? See 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.11,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48664:102"/> 12. <hi>And the Lord said to</hi> Solomon, <hi>Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my Covenant</hi> â€” <hi>I will surely rent the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from thee, and will give it to thy Servant</hi> â€” Is it by a Combination of Forreign Enemies, that a King, or Kingdom Suffers? See what the Lord says, <hi>Esay</hi> 9.11, 12. <hi>I will set up the Adversaries of</hi> Rezin <hi>against him, and joyn his Enemies together; The</hi> Syrians <hi>before, and the</hi> Philistines <hi>behind, and they shall devour</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>with open mouth.</hi> See also 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11.14.23. Is it by change of Government, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours? See <hi>Psal.</hi> 75.7. <hi>God is the Judge, he putteth down one, and setteth up another:</hi> And <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.21. <hi>God changeth the Times and Seasons, He removeth Kings, and setteth up Kings.</hi> Is it by an Evil Spirit of Jealousie and Treachery, that a Place, or People are punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? See <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.23. <hi>Then God sent an evil Spirit between</hi> Abimelech <hi>and the Men of</hi> She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem; <hi>and the Men of</hi> Shechem <hi>dealt Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously with</hi> Abimelech. Doth any suffer by the Disobedience, and Disloyalty of bad Children? See 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 12.11. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, I will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house, and,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the Truth of the second particular, Experience doth manifest it. As for Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is our manner to look at all that are in our way, and if they do not presently appear,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48664:102"/> but lye hid, it is our manner, like Dogs of the Game, to Hunt after them, and to beat about, whereby to find them out. But all this while we do not look through them, or above them; being like the Horse and Mule, that have no Understanding; or like the Currish Dog, that doth onely run after the stone that is cast at him, not at all regarding the Hand that hurl'd it. This is that brut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>shness, which God complains of, <hi>Esay</hi> 26.11. <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see.</hi> And this also is a sin implyed in the words of my Text, according to another rendring of the Phrase <hi>(If ye walk contrary unto me,)</hi> and which some do adhere unto; the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word signifying both contrariety and chance, according to which latter reddition of the word, the meaning is, If ye walk at all Adventures, carelessly, come on't what will, not regarding your punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as proceeding from the hand of God, but as coming by chance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That this regardlessness of God as the Author of our punishments, is one main cause of Incorrigibleness, doth appear both by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Scripture. It cannot well be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that sinners should return to the Lord, till such times as they are sensible, that it is he, who hath smitten, to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n, or wounded them, <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.1. Or till they do acknowledge (to speak in the words of God himself in the ore
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48664:103"/> and fortieth verse of this Chapter) that it is God that hath walked contrary to them, in the punishments that were upon them. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> regarded not the Credenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of <hi>Moses</hi> in those miraculous Plagues that were inflicted on them, till they were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that they proceeded from God, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the print of his finger in them.</p>
               <p>For a Remedy then in this Case, be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Observe and Confess, that under all our punishments, it is God who walks contrary unto us; whatever our Suffering be, say of it, as the King of <hi>Israel</hi> did of that Famine at the Siege of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mic.</hi> 6 9. Hear, as the Rod it self, so who hath appointed, or inflict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d it.</note> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.33. <hi>This evil is of the Lord.</hi> As the Prophet said in another Case, <hi>Esay</hi> 46.8. So I say here, <hi>Remember this, and shew your selves Men, (i. e.)</hi> Men, and not Brutes, which look no further than their outward senses will enable them to do, having not the understanding of Men, or Rational Creatures to do more. As for Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is our wisdom sometimes not to look at them all, but it is our wisdom always to look through and above them unto God. This is short work, and safe work.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the Issue, it is short work; for if we look after the Instruments of our Sufferings, it is oft-times a long piece of work, and a work
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48664:103"/> of difficulty to find them out, they having dig'd deep to hide their Councels, and their ways being in the dark. But if we will but open our Eyes, we may presently discern God to be the Author of our Calamities.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is sure and safe work; for as to the Grand Instruments of our Sufferings, we may hunt (as unexperienced Hounds sometimes do) upon a wrong scent, and think that we have found out the <hi>Achans,</hi> the Instruments of our Grievances, who indeed are not so. A mistake oft-times of sad and dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Thus did <hi>Ahab</hi> mistake in eying the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> as the Troubler of <hi>Israel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 18.17, 18. But as to the Author, or Inflicter of our Sufferings, in this surely we cannot be mistaken; but whensoever, or howsoever we suffer, we may safely say, with Repenting <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Jer. 31.18. <hi>Thou hast Chastised me, and I was Chastised;</hi> and this is the first thing, which as one means conducing to our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; By These things, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements I do exhort you unto, and that not without Cause: For had we not heard this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment from <hi>Ephraim (Thou hast Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised me)</hi> in all probability we had not heard of <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s Repentance and Conversion in the words immediately following.</p>

               <p n="2">2. ANother Impediment to Reformation, or Cause of Incorrigibleness, is sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners their not Observing, at least, their slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and despising, and not laying to Heart the Judgments of God which are upon them. This is a sin too too Common among Men, in that they despise the Judgments of God, not onely when threatned, and impendent, but when inflicted and incumbent upon them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taking no notice at all of their Afflicted Condition, or not laying it to Heart: This the Prophet of God doth frequently Complain of, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Strangers have devoured his Strength, yet he</hi> (meaning <hi>Ephraim) knoweth it not; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.</hi> And <hi>Esay</hi> 42.25. <hi>He hath poured upon him the fury of his Anger, and the strength of Battel, and it hath set him on Fire round about, yet he knew it not, and it burned him, yet he laid it not to Heart.</hi> The Pride of sinners under their Sufferings doth testifie to their Faces, that they do not so know their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Condition, as to lay it to Heart. This is the Evidence of the Prophets Judgment brought in against <hi>Ephraim.</hi> And the Proof is Apodeictical, or Demonstrative, and past all denyal. This Pride of Heart, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48664:104"/> Gods Judgments on them, was their sin also complained of by the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> Chap. 9.9, 10.

The like sin Complained of, and threatned, See in <hi>Esay</hi> 22.12, 13. which may be read at leisure. And O that God would give us to see, what woes do hang over the Heads of Thousands in this Luxurious Age for their continued Drunkenness and intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of all sorts, that will abate nothing, that tends to the satisfying of their insatiable Lusts, let God and his Judgments, the Lord by his Judgments upon us call for what he will. This manifests how far we are, not onely from a present Reformation, but also from all hopes of a Reformation; for till we lay to heart the heavy hand of God upon us, we are never like to be bettered, or Reformed by it, which was the thing to be proved: For a Remedy therefore, and in Order to our being Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by these things, I shall in the Name of God Admonish you not to despise them, but to be, as is meet, affected with them: I shall do both in the words of God himself, speaking to us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. <hi>My Son, despise not thou the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening of the Lord.</hi> And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Humble your selves under the Mighty hand of God.</hi> Let all the Ensignes of Pride be solded up in such black and sad Times as these; even as it is the manner of the Papists to cover their Images with black, that they may not be seen (if I

The like I say concerning Drunkenness, and Intemperance of all sorts. O how unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable is sensual Mirth and Jollity at such a Time as this?

Observe what follows. <hi>Should we then make Mirth?</hi> Alas, how may we cry out, A Sword, a Sword, that hath already made a sore Slaughter, and what further Slaughter it will make, God alone doth know. Well therefore may it be said to us, <hi>And should we now make Mirth?</hi> What manner of Question is this, think we?

               <p n="1">1. Labour to be sensible, that this is the very cause of your not being Reformed hitherto, &amp; &amp; acknowledge it, not excusing the Obstinacy, perverseness of your Wills, or your wilful persisting in sin, saying, I had a great mind and will to the contrary, to be better, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my Old course of Life, to leave my old haunts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Confess, as the Truth is, That you have set at nought Gods Counsel, and would none of his Reproof, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.25.

               <p n="2">2. As for the Future, be Admonished to take heed of Wilfulness, of being wedded to your own Wills in Competition with, or in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the Will of God. This is that, which
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:48664:114"/> Scripture styles stiff-neckedness, or to have a Neck as an Iron Sinew, which by Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to have an Obstinate Will, <hi>Esay</hi> 48.4. <hi>I know,</hi> saith God to <hi>Judah, that thou art ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, and thy Neck is as an Iron Sinew;</hi> (and observe what follows) <hi>and thy brow brass.</hi> If our Necks do once come to be an Iron Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, our brows will soon become as Brass.

Such a self-will'd sinner, we may be sure, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want woe, as the Proverb hath it. O
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:48664:115"/> pray to God to give you a self-denying will, to take away this self-will, this stiff will of yours, and to give you a plyant and comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will (to speak in allusion to that expression of God himself, by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 36.26.) A new Heart, a new Spirit, a new Will, as doth the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> saying, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, O God, and renew a right Spirit within me.</hi> Pray to God both to incline, and to dis-incline your wills, as doth <hi>David,</hi> saying, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.36. <hi>Incline my Heart unto thy Testimonies, and not to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 141.4. <hi>Incline not my Heart to any evil thing,</hi> (i. e.) Dis-incline my Heart from every evil thing, <hi>not to practise wicked works with Men that work Iniquity, and let me not eat of their Dainties.</hi> The rather it concerns us to do it, because till this Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wilful stubbornness, or stubborn wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness be taken out of the way, a sinner can never be Reformed, his [will not] being his [cannot] as was afore said and proved. <hi>If you be Willing and Obedient,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> Chap. 1.19.

As St. <hi>Paul</hi> said of Zeal, which indeed seems to be an intense VVill, or intensiveness of VVill, (<hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18. <hi>It is good</hi>

                  </gap> in a good Matter, the thing Reformation. Such a firm and resolute VVill had St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that would not bow, could not be bowed by any perswasions, or disswasions, he saying to his well-wishing Friends (whose Oratory is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally most potent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent) <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13.<note place="margin">Old Oaths having been so long in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, it's time now, that they were out of Fashion; let all swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers therefore, but more especially Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen-swearers, take up some new kind of Oath: This of <hi>David,</hi> with Respect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I say, Let every Man Swear in the Name of God.</note>

I shall exhort you then, that with the like purpose of Heart, and bent of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48664:116"/> VVill you would Resolve upon a Reformation. Imitate <hi>David, I have said,</hi> says he, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.57. <hi>that I would keep thy Word.</hi> Said? Yea, sworn: For so he says, <hi>v.</hi> 106. <hi>I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy Righteous Judgments.</hi> Hear me, O ye Swearers, here is a new Oath for you, O ye God Damn-me's!

                  </gap>th Impediment to be removed out of the way of Reformation, is Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Trust and Confidence. And by this I mean, a trusting to two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. External Helps, and Helpers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. External Priviledges, and certain Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Performances.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I will begin with the latter, <hi>viz.</hi> Vain Confidence in Church-Priviledges, and Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Performances. This was the sin of the Jews, of which we read in many Scriptures; They called themselves of the Holy City, and did thereupon may themselves upon the God of <hi>Israel, Esay</hi> 48.2. saying, <hi>Is not the Lord amongst us?</hi> They concluded thereupon, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>None evil can come upon us,</hi> Mic. 3.11. Being called Jews, they did rest in the Law, and made their boast of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17. <hi>We be</hi> Abraham's <hi>Seed,</hi> say they, <hi>John</hi> 8.33. And again, <hi>Abraham is our Father,</hi> say they, v. 39. Thereupon they trusted to Inherit the Blessing of <hi>Abraham.</hi> But the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> tells them, These were but lying words, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Behold, ye trust in lying Words,, saying, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord.</hi> Again, They trusted to the Performance of certain External Services, their frequenting
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48664:117"/> the Temple and Synagogue-Worship, their Sacrificing the Blood of Bulls and Goats, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side-Fasting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to these things they trusted, as appears by <hi>Esay</hi> 58.3. <hi>Wherefore have we Fasted, say they? Wherefore have we Afflicted our Soul,</hi> &amp;c. But it appears by that Chapter, how vain that their Confidence was, as well by what they said, as by what God said of that their Service; they say as Men dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in their Expectation, that God would not afford them or their Services a good look, or take any Notice of them (<hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have we fasted, and thou seest not? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> â€”) And it appears by what God says, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Is it such a Fast that I have chosen? A Day for a Man to afflict his Soul? Is it to bow down his Head like a Bulrush</hi> â€” See how vain this Confidence of theirs was, by what we find written more at large in <hi>Esay</hi> 1.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>To what purpose is the multitude of your Sacrifices of me, saith the Lord</hi> â€” Cui bono?</p>
               <p>Let us then be admonished of this kind of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Trust. What, though we are Christians Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the Faith of Christ, will this secure us from Ruine here, or from Hell hereafter? Surely our Baptism will no more profit a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, than Circumcision did a Jew; of which, see what the Apostle says, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.25. <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision verily profiteth, if thou keep the Law, but
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:48664:117"/> if thou be a breaker of the Law, thy Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is made uncircumcision.</hi> How may it be said to a Christian, <hi>Mutato nomine de te nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratur</hi> â€” Change but the Names of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Jew into that of Christian and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, and the self-same saying we may be sure is verified of us. Read the Verses following, which are of great Use, and worthy of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, whereby it will appear, that an honest Heathen is much to be preferred to a wicked Christian. What though we are Sons of the Protestant Church, the truly Ancient and Catholick Church? We may be Children of the Devil for all that, as our Saviour told them who pretended themselves to be as good as we, saying, <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>Ye are of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil;</hi> and if the same can be prov'd against us, as was charg'd upon them, <hi>viz. That we do the Lusts, the works of the Devil,</hi> it's a thing past denyal that we are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Children.</p>
               <p>Again, Let us be Admonished not to trust to our Performance, yea, constant Performance of External Duties, be it the Observation of a Solemn Fast (Anniversary and standing, or else Occasional;) for to our weekly coming to Church, hearing daily Prayers Read Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening. I say, trust not to these <hi>[Caeteris imparibus]</hi> so long as your Lives are wicked, and you Live in a constant neglect of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:48664:118"/> the great things of Gods Law. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. It is a vain thing to cry Lord, Lord, and to alledge what good Ministers we have heard, and how many times we have been partakers at the Lords Table, if in the mean while we have been workers of Iniquity. It is a vain thing for such to scrape Acquaintance with Christ, who hath told them their doom before hand, and what they are therefore to trust unto, <hi>viz.</hi> A commanded departure from him, with a <hi>non novi vos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is another kind of Carnal Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is a great Impediment to Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by the Judgments of God upon us, <hi>viz.</hi> A confiding to external help and helps, whether our own strength, or the strength of our Confederates. This was another sin of the Jews, frequently charged upon them by the Prophets. See <hi>Hos.</hi> 5.13. <hi>When</hi> Ephraim <hi>saw his sickness, and</hi> Judah <hi>saw his wound, then went</hi> Ephraim <hi>to the</hi> Assyrian, <hi>and sent to King</hi> Jareb, <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.11. <hi>They call to</hi> Egypt, <hi>they go to</hi> Assyria: And Chap. 8.9. <hi>They are gone up to</hi> Assyria. And sometimes it was their sin to trust to their own single strength, this being the sin of King <hi>Æ²zziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.15. And this (it is very much to be doubted) hath been our sin in this Nation, and for which among other our sins we have Suffered in these latter times. O what boasting and bragging
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:48664:118"/> hath been heard amongst us, especially since we have had Forreign Assistance? How many Battels have we won before one was fought? How many times have our Enemies been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly vanquished, before, or as soon as they were in sight? And verily, if Vapouring and Boasting, if Cursing and Swearing, and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <item>1. That we may see it; and</item>

But (lest I seem over tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) let it suffice to say, That it doth Argue great forgetfulness of God, a great strangeness to him, and an alienation from him; it self is a forgetting of God, and so to be denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: It is a kind of Idolatry and Adultery, that which we call Spiritual Adultery and Idolatry, <hi>viz.</hi> An Idolizing of the Creature, a putting God out of place, a putting him beside his Throne (wherein he sits as Supreme Lord, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Disposer of all) and setting up our selves in his stead. At once it is an extreme forgetting both of the Creator and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;

May not we say to them, <hi>Quid verba audiam, cum facta videam?</hi> Must we believe the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressour, or not rather his Transgressions; I mean, what the wicked Transgressours do say in, or with their Lives and Practices, rather than what they say with their Tongues and Lips.</p>

               <p n="2">2. As the Instrumentally efficient Cause of Subjective Reformation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods Word is the Rule of Reformation. Whence that of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> (119.9.) <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal shall a Young Man cleanse his way?

I put in those Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictive Expressions [in its kind, and as to the ends thereby intended by God] lest any one should <gap reason="foreign">

Know then, that Gods Word, although it's a Rule, <hi>In suo genere,</hi> yet it is not so <hi>in omni genere</hi> (i. e.) It is not a Rule to Direct us in all manner of Actions of Humane Life, <hi>e. g.</hi> It doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Artists, the Professors of ony Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences (styled Liberal, or illiberal) the best way, or Method, how to manage and Order their work, Masons and Carpenters how to

               <p n="2">2. Although Gods Word in some things was intended for a Rule, yet not a like Rule in those very things; for in some things it was intended onely as a general, and in some things as a particular Rule. <hi>e. g.</hi> In some things it was intended onely as a general Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> In Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of Gods Worship not determined by God himself in his Word; Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as to Vestures, Postures, Gestures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gods Word doth not determine the site or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of a Minister in Preaching; whether to standing, or sitting; nor his Vest, whether as to Linnen, or Wollen; whether as to black, or blew, green, or white; or as to his Head, whether he Preach Covered, or uncovered: Nor doth it determine the posture, whether of the Ministers, or the Peoples Receiving the Lords Supper, whether to standing, sitting, or kneeling, nor to the manner of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, whether by the Mouth onely, or by Hand and Mouth; whether by taking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the Elements from the Table, or Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from the Hand of the Minister.

And it becomes Christians, as they Love their own Peace (I mean, not onely their External Peace and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, but also the Peace of their own Consciences and freedom from superstitious enlargements thereof) or the Peace of the Church whereof they are Members, to take heed of stretching Gods Word beyond its Line, by making it a Rule in, or for such things as it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for, or by making it a particular Rule in such things, wherein God did intend it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a Rule as to generals.

It were easie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the mischiefs of doing otherwise, to which mischiefs it hath betrayed the <hi>Socinians,</hi> Anabaptists, with many others among us, whom I am loath to give a Name unto.</p>

There is nothing necessary to Salvation, whether to be believed, or practised; to be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48664:132"/> done, or left undone, but what this Word of God doth reveal. And as to these things it is a perfect and an adequate Rule. If any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shall pretend, that such and such a thing is sinful, and ought to be Reformed, and that such and such things are wanting, and ought therefore to be supplyed; he ought to produce the Word of God as the Rule in such Matters, proving by the Sriptures, that such and such things are forbidden by the VVord as sinful, and that such and such things are Commanded by the VVord as necessary Duties, and of stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Obligation; otherwise we may Answer, as one of the Ancients in a like Case, <hi>Non cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, non ago, quia non lego,</hi> I do not believe it, I do not practise it, because I do not find it Commanded in Scripture, or I do practise it, because I do not find it there forbidden. Thus do we maintain the Word of God to be in its kind, and as to the Salvation of Mens Souls, a perfect Rule; I mean, we do thus maintain it against the Papists, who do obtrude their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Traditions, as of equal Necessity and Authoriry with the Scriptures.

We may truly affirm, that albeit sinners are sometimes Reformed by Gods VVord without his Rod, yet never by his Rod without his VVord. It is by means of Gods Rod that he doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bring his VVord to their remembrance, (which otherwise would never have been minded) and doth set it home upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences. Thence that saying of <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 94.12. <hi>Blessed is the Man whom thou chasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, O Lord, and Teachest him out of thy Law.</hi> It is not meer Chastisements, of themselves, without the Divine Teachings of the VVord, that doth work any sinner to a blessed Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>

As we do therefore bless our Food, and Physick, so should we pray to God to bless our Afflictions, that the Lord would turn the Curse into a Blessing, and make them to be as Healing Medicines to our Spiritual Maladies. As the Mariners therefore did awaken <hi>Jonah,</hi> saying, <hi>What meanest thou, O Sleeper?

               <p n="1">1. Sometimes want of Power, such being the Offenders, either for their Number or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as that Governours cannot do what they would.

               <p n="2">2. Sometimes Magistrates want Will to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Offenders, too too many being like <hi>Gallio,</hi> altogether careless to do their Office: Though they have the Sword in their hand, and have full hold of it, yet they bear it in vain. But neither of these, neither Power nor Will are wanting in God.</p>

The God of <hi>Israel</hi> is called the strength of <hi>Israel,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.29. Prov. 21.30. <hi>There is no Wisdom, nor Æ²nder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>standing, nor Counsel against the Lord.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is no want of Will in God to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish un-reformed sinners; this he hath declared in the Text it self,<note place="margin">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48664:149"/> Power and Will together in that one Scripture, <hi>Nah.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>God is Jealous, and the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeth; the Lord Revengeth and is furious; the Lord will take vengeance on his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and he reserveth wrath for his Enemies. The Lord is slow to Anger, and great in Power</hi> â€” And if God say, He will do a thing, we may well believe that it will Infallibly be done; <hi>For God is not a Man, that he should lye, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Son of Man, that he should Repent: Hath he said, and shall he not do it? Or hath be spoken, and shall he not make it good?</hi> Num. 23.19. O how vain is it for un-reformed sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinners to think, that they can escape punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from God!

And let all the People say Amen, and Amen. See a like formidable Scripture, <hi>Esay</hi> 22.12, 13, 14. where for the sin of Incorrigibleness God threatens, saying, <hi>Surely this Iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die.</hi> O let the Consideration of this perswade us to a timely Reformation by these things, lest God give us up to our wills, and leave us to our selves to walk in our own Counsels (as he did <hi>Israel</hi> of Old, <hi>Psal.</hi> 81.11, 12.) and to resolve, That if we will harden our selves, we shall be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; yea, forasmuch as like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> we will be hardned, he will harden our hearts, and we shall be hardned.

God will not spare such un-reformed sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners upon the intreaty of others: The Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Heaven, though never s highly in Gods favour; though <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> though <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> should be the Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.

Let the Consideration of this move sinners to Reform by these things, especially considering,</p>
               <p n="5">5. How, or in what degree and measure God will punish such un-reformed sinners. This is expressed in the words of my Text,<note place="margin">It is expressed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in v. 28. by the Addition of the word (<hi>Vackhamath,</hi> in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) God there threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, not simply, as before <hi>(I will walk contrary unto you)</hi> but I will walk contrary unto you in Fury.</note> yet seven times for your sins. The thing here to be considered is, That God will punish this
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48664:155"/> sort of sin, or sinners with a witness. But some, perhaps, will put the like Question to me, as the Prophet <hi>Ahijah,</hi> in his denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Judgment against the House of <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam,</hi> did unto himself, saying, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.14. <hi>[But what?]</hi> In like sort possibly may the Question be demanded of me, But what? <hi>(i. e.)</hi> But when? When will God punish these un-reformed sinners seven times more for their sins? <hi>Answ.</hi> Both here and hereafter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here; I know not, nor doth any one know to the contrary, but that the Question may be Answered, as was that of the said Prophet himself, <hi>Even now:</hi> Even now in this Time, the Time of this Life doth the Lord punish the said un-reformed sinners seven times more for their sins, as hath already been more at large proved, and that by divers sad Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Recorded in Scripture for our Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let sinners then consider, and Oh that we in this Nation would consider, That God hath not punished us so much already for our sins (by Plague and Pestilence, Fire and Sword by Land and Sea) but he can punish us much more, seven, yea, seventy seven times more; Things are not so bad with us at present, but they may be seven times worse; yea, be it considered, what cause we have to fear (our sins being as they are) that things will be yet seven times worse: For as <hi>Ahab</hi> said of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cajah,</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:48664:155"/> so may we say of the words of this my Text, <hi>They Prophecy no good concerning us, but evil;</hi> yea, evil in an high degree: I say, no good at all, unless we our selves grow better. So that till we mend, it cannot be expected, that things should mend, but rather that they should wax worse and worse. Let me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon say to sinners, that go on still in their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, in some such words, as they to God in their Prayers (<hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.32. <hi>Let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our Kings, on our Princes, and on our Priests, and on all thy People</hi> â€”) O let not all the Calamities that have come upon us, on our late King and his Royal Throne, on our Nobility, and on our Gentry, on our Clergy, and on our Laity, even on all the People of these three Kingdoms, seem little before you; and let me add, saying in the words of the same Author, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.18. Will you bring more wrath upon <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> by continuing in your Prophanations? I will not say to you, whereby to hasten your Reformation, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Courtiers did to their Master, whereby to speed his Order for the <hi>Israelites</hi> Departure out of his Dominions, <hi>Knowest thou not that</hi> Egypt (that <hi>England) is Destroyed.</hi> But this I say, It becomes and concerns us to know, what Destruction to the Nation is deserved by us; yea, and threatned
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:48664:156"/> to us, if we will not be Reformed by these things. O how many ways hath God to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish any Person or People, that will not be Reformed by his Judgments? Call to mind what hath been spoken more particularly in the way of Explication, how, or wherein God may be said to punish sinners seven times for their sins. The remembrance of a few <hi>Latine</hi> words <hi>(ExtensivÃ¨, IntensivÃ¨, ProtensivÃ¨, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulativÃ¨, DestructivÃ¨, SuccessivÃ¨)</hi> may bring much to our minds.

O give not the Children, which are already born, or may be born of you Occasion to Curse you, by Reason of those Plagues and Curses which you have laid up in store for them. Let

As <hi>Job</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore says of himself, that he did intreat his Wife, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.17. So I shall intreat you, Gentlemen, if ever these Sermons shall happen to come in sight of your Eyes, even for the Childrens sake of your own Bodies: I say again, even for the Childrens sake of your own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that ye would cease your Debaucheries of all sorts, those Debaucheries of yours, the noyse whereof hath filled, for ought I hear, even all Corners and Quarters of the Land.</p>
